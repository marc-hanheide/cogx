;;; ------------
;;; move:	takes the robot from a place (?from) to a given goal place (?to), marking 
;;; 		the goal place as visited. visited is assigned true, and updated to true.
;;; look-for-objects:	given that the robot is in a place, the action performs a look-for-objects
;;; 		action in that place, and marks and updates the place as searched.
