   ;; A "model" is something that we typically associate with Machine
   ;; Learning (ML), or an ML-based algorithm. We suppose that Dora2.0
   ;; has a limited capacity with regards to the number of "models" that
   ;; can be "foregrounded" at any given time. Hence we provide a
   ;; limited number of "model-slots". There are some "models", such as
   ;; face-detection "models", that may be able to be foregrounded all
   ;; the time -- i.e., perhaps because there is very low resource
   ;; consumption wrt using that "model". In this case, we shall suppose
   ;; a "model-slot" is occupied by that "model", and that planning
   ;; cannot decide to use that "model-slot" for some other purpose.
