                  };


  # ! Only 'event' (top level) and 'state' are used in the grammar

## ENTITY ##

  # ! Only 'entity' (top level), physical, e-time-point, e-time-unit
  # ! are used in the grammar
  # ! This is because very few 'semantic' selectional constraints
  # ! have been included in the grammar

  #            Moreover, any changes to this will require changes in these files:

  #            See these files for specifics.
