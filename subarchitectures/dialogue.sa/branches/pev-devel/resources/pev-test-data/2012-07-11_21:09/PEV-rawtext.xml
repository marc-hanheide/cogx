<string>my task was to search for a magazine and to find it
I assumed a magazine was in the room two and this room was a meetingroom
I went to the place five via the place two from the place zero
I went to the place eight via the place seven from the place five
I went to the place fourteen via the place eleven from the place eight
I went to the place seventeen via the place fifteen from the place fourteen
I went to the place nineteen via the place eighteen from the place seventeen
I went to the place twentyone via the place twenty from the place nineteen
because I wanted to create cones in the room two at the place twentyone
I wanted to search for a magazine in the room two at the place twentyone
then I assumed a magazine was in the room two and this room was a meetingroom
I created cones in the room two at the place twentyone because magazines are often in the room two
because I wanted to search for a magazine in the room two at the place twentyone
after that I assumed a magazine was in the room two and this room was a meetingroom
I did not search for a magazine in the room two at the place twentyone
afterwards I assumed the room two was a meetingroom
I did not search for a magazine in the room two at the place twentythree
after that I assumed the room two was a meetingroom
I did not search for a magazine in the room two at the place twentyone
