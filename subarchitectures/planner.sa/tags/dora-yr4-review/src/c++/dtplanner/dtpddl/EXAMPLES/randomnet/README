To COMPILE the Power Supply Restoration problem generator, you want
to:

 - Install ccache

 - Invoke 

   make clean; make 


If you don't want to install ccache for some insane reason, then just
edit the make file and remove it from the CXXPREFIX variable.

To RUN the Power Supply Restoration problem generator, you want to
execute something like the following on the command line:

./psr --circuit_breakers 1 --remote_switches 2  --faulty-lines 1.0 generate_network soft_goal

This will generate a problem file, and a domain file, as follows.

PSR-DOMAIN-CB1-L3-SD2.dtpddl
PSR-DOMAIN-CB1-L3-SD2.dtpddl

The first switch informs the program how many circuit breakers to
include on the network. the second switch informs the program how many
remotely controllable switches to include on the network. the third
switch specifies the probability that a line is faulty. The
penultimate argument asks the program to actually generate a
network. The last argument specifies that the DTPDDL should have a
soft goal -- i.e., the goal of the problem is a net-benefit goal
expression.
