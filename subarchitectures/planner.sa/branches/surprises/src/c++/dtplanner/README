This is not going to work until you build the software on which it
relies. For the moment you can do that manually as follows:

cd dtpddl
make libdtplanning

The above is all that is required for the current code that is merged
with CAST.

Also, try and build a simple POMDP solver. This shall require you
install some libraries. 

cd cassandra
make

Testing with _domain_ and _problem_ files:


dtpddl/EXAMPLES/test3.domain.pddl
dtpddl/EXAMPLES/test3.problem.pddl
