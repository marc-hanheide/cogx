For use in an integrated continual planning and execution monitoring
system on a mobile robot platform, we developed a planner that
switches between: (a) fast sequential planning, and (b) expensive DT
planning in small abstractions of the problem at hand. Given a DTPDDL
model of the environment, sequential planning is used to compute an
initial sequential plan and complementary runtime evolution of the
decision process. That plan is executed until the outcome of the next
action scheduled for execution is too uncertain. At that point a DT
session performs sensing that can help determine how the sequential
plan might evolve, or otherwise acts to achieve the goals. We find our
approach performs quickly and relatively efficiently in a number of
large real-world task and observation planning problems.

\Omit{
The most pressing item for future research, is to develop a scheme
whereby the serial planner can relax {\em executability} assumptions,
so that conformant (or semi-conformant) plans can be executed without
interruption by a DT session. A more general criticism of
switching continual planning concerns interleaved sequential and
DT sessions failing to make any progress towards the
objectives. For example, in the worst case we can have each sequential
session producing an identical plan, and each decision-theoretic
session rejecting it without further sensing. Although this has not
been an issue in our work so far, it must be dealt with rigorously
in the future. We suggest that a good way to mitigate this problem is
by developing a {\em motivational} component that maintains a {\em
dynamic} reward model whose limiting behaviour prevents that switching
deadlock.
