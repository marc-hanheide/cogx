/*  ... Before the war <<WW2>> he had done it to Mauriac. The great
 * Catholic writer had just published {\em La Fin De La Nuit}. It was a
 * classic. It was praised to the skies by the critics. Well received by
 * readers. In hindsight, it is one of Mauriac's really fine novels. Then
 * along came Sartre, who, in an article in the {\em Nouvelle Revue
 * Francais}, explained that the whole art of the older writer rested on
 * the postulate that the writer `plays the same role towards his
 * creatures as God does towards his`, and that he, Sartre, was in a
 * position to assert, from the heights of the legitimacy that the
 * publication of {\em Nausea} alone, a year earlier, had just granted
 * him, that what we had here was an unforgivable `technical error`
 * compounded by a philosophical blunder; the novelist `is not God`; he
 * `does not have the right to pronounce his absolute judgements` or to
 * manipulate his characters as puppets in the way Mauriac did; he does
 * not have the right to enter into their reasons or their unreasons,
 * their paltry contradictions so obviously strung together by the
 * omniscient narrator's designs on them, and so here is the verdict he
 * felt obliged to deliver: {\em La Fin De La Nuit} `is not a novel`, for
 * `God is not an artist and neither is Monsieur Mauriac`. The victim
 * swallows the insult. He didn't respond, he took it on the chin, and,
 * playing a close game, didn't disdain, as the years went by -- for
 * example, at the time of Sartre's preface to {\em Aden Arabie} -- to
 * pay homage to his adversary's talent. But he waited thirty years
 * before risking publishing a new novel. Sartre, he said, tried `from
 * the outset, twenty years ago, [...] to throttle me`. And, on another
 * occasion, in answer to a journalist from {\em France-Soir} who asked
 * him what was the reason behind such a long silence, he replies: {\em
 * La Fin De La Nuit} had been `panned by Sartre`, who was `not only a
 * very young author, but at the same time the glory of his generation`;
 * and without going so far as to say that this `attack` demoralised him,
 * he admitted that it had `made me think`. Sartre was to regret the way
 * he had panned the novel. He later agreed, in 1960, that `all methods
 * are a form of rigging`, and that the celebrated `American methods`
 * that he had claimed, at the time, to be upholding in opposition to
 * Mauriac's literary interventionism were scarcely less artificial. But
 * that's how it was, in the final analysis. It was a period when a
 * literary panning, published in a review, could give you something to
 * think about for thirty years. A period, in 1939, the middle of the
 * twentieth century, when Sartre, still so very young, already had this
 * power to destroy a novelist...
