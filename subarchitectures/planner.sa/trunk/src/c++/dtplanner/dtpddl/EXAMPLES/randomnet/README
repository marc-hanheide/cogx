SYNOPSIS
  randomnet [-b -c -l -n -o -r -s -t -u -x]

DESCRIPTION
  Generate randomised power distribution networks consisting of
  circuit breakers (cb) and switching devices (sd) connected by
  lines. Output format is

    CB <c> 0 L <l> SD <s> 0
    <line definition>
    <line definition>
    ...

  where c is the number of circuit breakers, l the number of
  lines and s the number of switching devices. Each line
  definition is of the form

    <device type> <did> <s> l <lid> <device type> <did> <s>

  where each device type is either "cb" (for circuit breaker) or
  "sd" (for switching device), <did> is its (integer) id number,
  <s> is a side (1 or 2) and <lid> is the id of the line. The
  reading is that line number <lid> connects the specified sides
  of the two devices. For example,

    cb 3 2 l 8 sd 12 2

  means that side 2 of circuit breaker #3 and side 2 of switching
  device #12 are connected by line #8.

OPTIONS
  There are numerous options, mostly to control the average size
  and topology of the generated networks.

    -b <float>  The probability that a line branches. Default 0.4.

    -c <float>  The probability that an open switch not otherwise
                used to connect feeders together is connected to
                other devices on both sides, thus forming a loop
                in the network rather than a line to earth. Set to
                0.0 for a loop-free network, 1.0 for as many loops
                as possible. Default 0.5.

    -f <float>  The proportion of lines (selected at random) to be
                labelled as "faulty". If this option is given, a
                second random number seed may be specified with
                the -z option.

    -h          Help. Prints this text.

    -l <int>    Lower bound on the number of switching devices
                in each feeder (excluding the circuit breaker at
                the root). Used to eliminate trivial feeders such
                as those consisting only of a circuit breaker, or
                only a circuit breaker and one downstream switch.
		Default 2.

    -n <int>    The number of circuit breakers. Default 3.

    -o          Print a list of the devices saying which ones are
                open and which are closed in the initial state of
                the network. If this option is not included, only
                the configuration of lines is printed.

    -r <int>    Make <int> attempts to connect the feeders into a
                single network (a connected graph). Print a
                warning if no such graph is produced in the
                stated number of iterations. Default 100.

    -s <int>    Seed for the random number generator. Default 1.

    -t <float>  Probability that a switching device is terminal in
                its feeder. It is then open, unless it has a line
                out to earth. All non-terminal devices are closed.
                Default 0.45.

    -u <int>    Upper bound on the number of switching devices on
                a feeder. The random network generator can produce
                very large trees, and though this is rather rare,
                it can be annoying. If the "upper bound" is set to
                0, there is no limit and trees of any size may be
                generated. If it is positive, only feeders with
                numbers of switching devices in the range
                (lower-bound ... upper-bound) will be generated.
                Default 10.

    -x <float>  Probability that a line branches at least B+1 ways
                given that it branches at least B ways (for B > 1).
                Branching more than two ways is quite rare in real
                networks, so this should be a lower value than that
                given by the -b option. Default 0.15.

    -z <int>    Another random number seed. This one is for
                selecting which lines are faulty. If option -f is
                given, the default seed is 1. If -f is not given,
                -z makes no sense and will be silently ignored.

NOTES:
  The generator will not accept values for T, B and X which would
  lead to the expectation that the feeder trees would be infinite.
  The threshold for this occurs where the expected number of nodes
  at a given depth in the tree neither increases nor decreases
  with the depth. Higher values for T lead to finite trees with
  probability 1; lower values for T may lead to infinite ones. The
  required inequation for an expectation of finite trees is

           B
   T > ---------
       1 - X + B
