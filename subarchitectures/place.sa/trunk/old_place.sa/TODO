Notes on integration with NAV.SA
====================================
- nav.sa pulls information from place.sa
- in the pull request, it sends the following string: "id=<node_id> new=<0/1> gateway=<0/1>"
- if new=1, the robot just created or revisited a new node
- if new=1, the id is one of those we know and gateway= has changed, it means that the node was updated
- we sent back the NodePlaceInfo structure
- in this struct, class 0 is "Unknown"
- we should agree on place names with others
