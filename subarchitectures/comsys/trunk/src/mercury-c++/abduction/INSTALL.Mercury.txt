HOW TO INSTALL MERCURY

1) Download the Mercury compiler, it's the package "Compiler" at the
   bottom this page:

     http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/research/mercury/download/rotd.html

   The reason why I'm using the development branch is that it features some
   neat debugging constructions that might come handy when the Mercury
   component is connected to the rest of the system later on. It certainly
   isn't needed now (and shouldn't really be in the "logic" part, but should
   there be any problems with the Ice binding, I won't hesitate to use
   them ;)

2) Unpack it somewhere and enter that directory.

3) Run the following command (but only after you've read the short note
   under it):

     $ ./configure --enable-libgrades=hlc.gc,hlc.gc.prof,hlc.gc.memprof,hlc.gc.tr,hlc.par.gc

   I also recommend using the --prefix=INSTALLPATH option to `configure'
   so that you have the installation under control. The INSTALLPATH
   could look something like

     "$HOME/Devel/mercury-rotd-2009-07-05"

4) Run

     $ make

5) Run

     $ make install
   (For this you might need root access rights.)

6) Make sure that INSTALLPATH/bin is in your $PATH environment variable.

7) Export environment variable MERCURY_HOME to INSTALLPATH in your shell.
   You will need this to compile the abduction server.
