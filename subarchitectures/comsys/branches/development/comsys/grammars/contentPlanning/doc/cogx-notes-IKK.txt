Weird problem with ascription: 
@d1:dvp(c-goal  ^ <SpeechAct>assertion  ^ <Relation>answer  ^  <Content>(e1:ascription ^ <Target>(b2:entity ^ <InfoStatus>familiar ^ box)  ^ <Color>(b3:quality ^ blue))) 

NOTE: order within Target matters; if box not last, then Color gets not planned !!


Ascription wh-questions: alternative formulations
-- what color does the box have
-- which box has blue color
-- what object is this (object)


Multiple properties in ascription


Reference to multiple objects


Negation in ascription


Y/N answer


Ascription
"The red object is a ball"
"The red object is a big ball"


Acknowledgment
"Yes you are right"


Multiple utterances within a turn

e.g., sorry, (but) no
      yes, I see
      yes, it is blue
      no, it is not blue
      no/sorry, I do not see that


NPs with demonstrative determiners

e.g., this/that ball


Proximal vs. distal reference currently selected at random

e.g., this/that	  
      this/that ball



References to multiple objects (set of objects)

e.g., the/these/those balls
      the 3 balls
      these/those
      they				   


Acknowledgments with modality are completely hacked by templates
