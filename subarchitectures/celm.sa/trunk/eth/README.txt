The format for the event type hierarchy source files is:

type<TABULATOR>subtype
type<TABULATOR>subtype
....


Multiple inheritance is allowed. 

Remember to stick to a robot first-person perspective ("I, Robot") and to run
subarchitectures/celm/bin/loadEventTypeHierarchy <type_hierarchy_file>
before issuing queries based on the new hierarchy!
