\section release6.1 release 6.1

September 5, 2008

The default locations are no longer ASSERTED, but rather get a
TYPICAL TemporalFrame feature. Under the hood, the planner treats
them the same way.

Referring expressions are generated along the following pattern:
@e42:entity(office ^ <Owner>(e43:entity ^ person ^ <Name>Nick ^ <Unique>true) ^ <Unique>true)


\section release6 release 6

September 2, 2008

The default location provider should work now.
The reference resolver ignores any ASSERTED relation proxy.
That should be changed to DEFAULT -- if there only were a DEFAULT TemporalFrame ;-)

Some additions to the ontology:
Game as subconcept of AbstractEntity 
with subcons Colour_game (equivalentClass Color_game), Shape_game, and Unknown_game 
and Shape is a subcon of Thing (equivalent of Object)

Fixed 'ant clean' target to also delete autogen files.

Renamed 
		ComaResolverBindingMonitor -bsa binding.sa --log true
to
		ComaOnDemandBindingMonitor -bsa binding.sa --log true


New struct for generating (multiple) coma proxies on demand:

  struct GenerateComaProxies {
    ComaInstanceList m_instanceWMPs;
    ComaConceptList m_conceptWMPs;
    ComaRelationList m_relationWMPs;
    sequence < string > m_conceptsOfDefaultProxy;
  };

The field m_conceptsOfDefaultProxy is reserved for listing
the possibly many concepts of the proxy for which a default
location is requested.

As a convention, the ComaRelations can also contain
WorkingMemoryPointers to ComaConcept WMEs in order
to make sure default locations get put on the binder!
Another convention is to use a WMP to the GenerateComaProxies WME
to indicate a relation with the multi-concept-default-proxy!

\section release5.2 release 5.2

August 23, 2008

The ComaReasoner now needs a -bsa flag
This is a maintenance release that actually
works together with planning/motivation.


\section release5.1 release 5.1

August 22, 2008

Added a struct to initiate resolving a referring expression
wrt the coma reasoner state.

  struct ResolveEntity {
  	cast::cdl::WorkingMemoryPointer m_entityWMP;
  };

There is a new component ComaResolverBindingMonitor, which
will create the proxies for the resolved entity.

	ComaResolverBindingMonitor -bsa binding.sa --log true

This release introduces a quick fix, aka ad hoc odd hack, that 
makes "Concept=Addresse" proxies bind with "Concept=Robot" proxies.
This is done by introducing a concept "Addressee" as subconcept of
"Robot" in the OWL ontology.

This release is NOT yet integrated with the planner.
Reference resolution can be used in fake mode, and the planner
uses also some dummy processes to resolve entities to area IDs
(in fact it will always be area 1).

\section release5 release 5

August 19, 2008

Added GRE stuff: 
The Coma Reasoner can now get a ComaReasonerFunction of type
"GenerateRefEx", it will then make use of a helper class 
called ComaGREAlgorithm in order to generate a string LF and
write back the result to its original function task.

coma.sa now depends on comsys.mk4

referring expressions can be tested

areas can now have names and numberTags

this is handled by the fake event generator

the coma tests will pass except test 10 -- the failure
is induced by the absence of a good reportPass function call.
I am aware of that, but don't prioritize fixing it right now.


\section release4.2 release 4.2

August 8, 2008
Maintenance release as a precursor for the initial Explorer release.
The ComaFakeEventGenerator now also takes a --no-gui flag that suppresses the text input window.
If you give the command "getInstances" to the ComaFakeEventGenerator, it will return
a list of *all known* instances, including pre-defined ones, such as persons.


\section release4.1 release 4.1

August 6, 2008

Added a component for multi-SA testing (requires tools/testing).
Contains binder r9.3, and local changes made to CAST from binder r9.3.


\section release4 release 4

July 30, 2008

uses the latest binder (r9) and the latest balt/cast (r16.1).

Some of my components now need more parameters in the cast file. If you are currently including any 
coma components in your cast files, you should have a look at, e.g.,
    subarchitectures/coma.sa/config/coma-test9.cast
and change your cast files accordingly. 

\section release3 release 3

June 11, 2008

streamlined the amount of external libraries shipped with the code, cf ./lib/ 

\section release2 release 2

release made for integration with the binder

\section release1 release 1

May 30, 2008 

The two previous  errors are fixed now. 
Then, there's also a new test checking some added functionality.


\section release0 release 0

May 28, 2008

The first test release of the conceptual mapping SA.
This is a preliminary release that just checks some basic reasoning and knowledge base manipulation
functionality. It comes with all necessary libraries I hope. That's obviously also tested.

I also expect some tests to fail sometimes. Since these failures are sort of random (and also 
don't happen at all sometimes), my test script calls the same tests three times. One of these 
tests is called with a different classpath in order to check for some other odd error only Nick 
experienced in the pre-tests.
