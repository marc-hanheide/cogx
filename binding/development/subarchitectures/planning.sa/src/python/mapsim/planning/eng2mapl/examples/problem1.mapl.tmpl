;; The following is an exact copy of the initial state, but
;; uses a renamed set of predicates.  These predicates are never
;; changed by the planner, so they can be used to refer to the
;; initial situation even after it has been changed, e.g. in the goal.
;; When writing out the problem, just replace "(" with "(i__"
;; in the init block.
