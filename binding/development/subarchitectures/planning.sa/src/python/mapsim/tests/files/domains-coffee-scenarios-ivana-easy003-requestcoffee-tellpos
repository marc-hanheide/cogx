# This run was created calling './mapsim -t domains/coffee/scenarios/ivana/easy003-requestcoffee-tellpos/'

There are 2 agents in this MAPSIM scenario: Anne and R2D2
# Anne's goal: (and (pos coffee anne) )
# R2D2's goal: (and (has-goal r2d2 true) )
 (1) Anne: request R2D2 'give R2D2 coffee Anne living_room'.
 (2) Anne tells R2D2 the value of 'pos coffee': 'kitchen'
 (3) R2D2: execute 'move R2D2 kitchen kitchen_door living_room'.
 (4) R2D2: execute 'grasp R2D2 coffee kitchen'.
 (5) R2D2: execute 'move R2D2 living_room kitchen_door kitchen'.
 (6) R2D2: execute 'give R2D2 coffee Anne living_room'.
MAPSIM terminates unsuccessfully.

# Anne knows that R2D2 doesn't know where coffee is
# -> she can tell him right away
# Even better future version would be that Anne does (1) and (2) in one step
# such conjunction of speech acts could be realized as "Get me the coffe from the  kitchen" (= issue for NLG)
