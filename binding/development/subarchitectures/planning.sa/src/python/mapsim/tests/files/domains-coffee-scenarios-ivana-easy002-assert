# R2D2's goal: (and (has-goal r2d2 true) )

There are 2 agents in this MAPSIM scenario: Anne and R2D2
 (1) Anne: 'The coffee is in the kitchen, R2D2.'
MAPSIM terminates unsuccessfully.

# Currently OK
# Should R2D2 give an acknowledgement?
# In fact, he shold ask himself, why is Anne telling him that
# --> goal inference! 
# if R2D2 responds to theinferred goal, e.g., "Do you want me to bring it?"
# then we are doing indirect speech acts of one sort
