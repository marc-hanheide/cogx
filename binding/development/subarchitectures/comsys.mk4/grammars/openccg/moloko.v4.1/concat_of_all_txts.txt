right 
may I start 
can I go any time I want 
hey 
alright 
shall I start 
okay hi robot 
look this is the room that you have to present to the children
and you should tell them 
everything that's in here 
and why is important to them 
let's begin with that 
cupboard over there
right 
has got 
let's see 
right there is a trophy there we start with the trophy 
this is a trophy that they won
in a competition 
they went running 
right 
and they won the competition 
and they got the trophy for that and they are really really proud of that 
that's why they put it up in here
next in you can see all the chocolates
uhm I suppose the kids are allowed to have some chocolates 
if they *wanna have *em tell them it's okay have some chocolate 
but they shouldn't take too many and they should brush teeth afterwards
the chocolate is important because they just won this trophy 
and they probably want to eat chocolate afterwards *cause they are hungry 
right what else 
show them 
the picture with the pirates 
and tell *em 
they are allowed they are allowed to play with the pirates if they want to
okay but they shouldn't take *em away because the other children also want to play with that 
pirates are quite cool actually 
then 
there is something like an mp3-player 
or minidisc recorder I'd a minidisc
minidisc-recorder 
look this is that one 
they need er they shouldn't touch that too much because they might break it so
if they go up to tell *em 
im/ er it's a minidisc-player 
and it's cool and you need that for university but
don't drop it on the floor tell *em not to drop it on the floor 
and I've got the flowers here
that is
hm 
okay then there is 
pins 
and needles 
and thread 
and 
scissors 
what I don't know why they want that in university but
you can show them that 
when something breaks they need *that in university too 
right what else do we need in the room 
you migh/ you might want to show them all the 
books and paper that they have and explain them
that everybody in the university reads lots lots lots of books 
and when they go to university one day they read lots lots lots of books too 
right then we go to this table the table by here
on the table what we have on the table let's see
we got lots of chocolate on the table 
again chocolate 
and 
pot 
tea 
and a game 
and those cups 
car and
like a remote control for the car and matches as well
okay they can probably have the chocolate 
okay 
blinkie 
but they should be careful with the matches 
right if they want to play 
play the game *term how to play the game is like a memory game 
probably want to search you database for instructions on how to play 
memory 
explain them how to be 
play the game 
right they can sit on the settee as well the settee by here
that one 
and play with the toys 
you got some sort of little *beardy
and a cow 
hugging by here 
some beany bo/ beany bag 
toys 
elk hedgehog duck 
so they can play play with them and
better put it back afterwards so that nobody stumbles over it 
right settee 
let's see what else we got 
now we've got uhm 
the sparkling water under by here
blinking 
and the bottles 
yeah if they want to play bowling with that 
maybe they want to I don't know 
they shouldn't be doing that so 
right 
also there is glasses 
like here 
cups and plates 
and cutlery 
I don't think they want to play with that 
but if they go there 
uhm 
yeah they 
should just be careful tell them to be careful would *ya 
but they want it if they want use it 
they should 
they are able to why not 
they *wanna make some tea they can have s/ make some tea by here 
explain how to put the water in and everything that they have to probably use 
right 
then you have got the coffee percolator
important e are you still looking at me 
hello 
it's not looking at me 
want to look over here to see yeah exactly 
look over here to see that 
look 
that's the coffee percolator 
that's for the grown-ups
probably not for them but if they *wanna have hot chocolate 
they could go to the instructors and ask them for it 
okay 
hello 
he is still looking at me 
exactly this 
this way 
come on 
have a look over here 
hello 
want to come here 
look by there 
robot this way 
come on come on come on come on come on yeah yeah yeah exactly exactly 
here we go 
keeps going back never mind 
but where you just looked 
that way 
you will have all the 
er you'll have cartoons and
drawing books and crayons er just drawing books 
where they can play with 
and 
superman books as well if they want to read superman books they can it take it over there sit down and
have a look 
and there is also computer newspapers but that's prob/ probably not interesting for them
what else do we have microwave 
they know that from back *home if they come here 
and look here then this is the microwave 
they know that then there is cups for them if they want to have hot chocolate
and coffee down *there
coffee for the uhm
for the grown-ups now 
right what else do we have 
and there is this little music thing 
hello 
not looking 
if they *wanna play with that they have to turn this little handle and then the music comes on
then there is games by here
card games then more card games and a little
digital 
game of chess 
and then there is this 
game where you can er
like a th/ three-dimensional 
game 
they could probably use that if they want to 
right what else have we got 
then there is lots of crayons for them and pencils 
for them to draw 
they can sit by the table and draw if they want to
then there is little stickers 
if they want to put stickers on that pictures as well
there is 
papers in all different colors
and there is scissors too
*if they want to do some 
make some little chips or something they can do that by here 
you have to be careful when they play with those scissors and those
cutting knives 
that they don't cut 
cut each other 
in some pieces or something or cut themselves so 
if they come here tell them be careful 
right then there is this 
folder where they can put their stuff in later maybe
right 
then we've got drawing equipment for geometry
I don't know if they need that 
they probably just want to leave it 
and then they've got the computer 
if they want to play with that 
it says please do not touch the the so
if they come up to the computer tell them please do not touch the computer 
right but they I suppose they can use all the pens and papers if they want to
right 
anything else oh the fridge 
there's some more pirates 
on the fridge do they stick here
alright 
so 
you've got these pirates by there
and more pirates by there so if they want to play with the pirates they can also go over there
and get some more pirates from the fridge see the fridge down there
exactly that way down there 
that's where the fridge is
and 
they can take those pirates and play with them over there as well if they want to
right 
what else 
oh yeah 
maybe there's all these 
pictures that the kids might be interested in
and I suppose that's from 
when somebody went away and sent the picture home
or sent a postcard home then 
they put it up there 
and there is all the 
medals and
diplomas that they got for f/
winning the running game 
right 
anything else I couldn't think 
yeah I think that should be it 
this a candle like
an egg 
this is a
rabbit 
of chocolate 
for Easter 
a little car 
a cup of coffee
a card that shows a
young woman 
for a game 
memory 
so this is
a bird 
little cow 
of the chinker bell 
a duck 
makes a sound 
like a cow 
this is a big *catch
some 
pencils 
the 
calculator perhaps
don't know 
here I've got 
once a time a card 
it shows a woman
I think it's queen Elisabeth 
this is a walkman 
some sweets 
lion 
for example 
Rudolph the reindeer 
and a cow it makes a sound like a duck
once again some games 
rummy skat 
for example 
and a game 
called 
and here 
a toy 
I don't know what it is
mhm 
a little monster 
this is a cut 
for 
paper 
just a little bit harder 
big fork little fork 
a spoon 
and a knife 
a little disc compact disc 
for the walkman I think
it's called
mini disc player 
so 
and this is a
price 
for 
the Finnbahn-Meeting 
a picture 
of Marlene Dietrich 
and a picture 
yes who is who was painted by
I think he was an expressionist 
and here I've got a card 
with a ship 
beach 
pirates 
yes 
some stickers with Winnie the Pooh 
some faces who are smiling 
or angry 
some stars 
and a little sound machine 
and these are some
papers 
for example with with clouds or stars 
and with this papers 
you 
can make a lot of 
nice things 
yes and with the cuts or the pencils 
yeah you 
can work a little bit to 
have some nice things 
it's a big machine 
with this machine you
can make coffee 
oh 
or only hot water 
to make a tea 
yes 
I think that was all 
okay hi my name is Frauke and er 
I am gonna 
explain you 
what explain what I see in this room and tell you where things are and everything
uhm 
but maybe I start from where I stand right now 
er when I look at the left 
I 
can see a desk 
on my left-hand side 
uhm a/ on this desk there is computer 
and a chair at the desk 
er 
and a lot of things 
on this desk for example a telephone and lots of things you need in the
well for 
working 
with a 
paper and 
the computer and everything
and then er 
behind the 
monitor of the
computer there is a pillar 
with decorated with lots of postcards 
uhm 
yeah but actually also there are two 
flowers 
on the desk and er
and another bigger plant that is beside the desk 
uhm 
yeah well in the f/ 
on the end of the room on the far back end there is a shelf with er lots of
papers and magazines I suppose
in it 
uhm 
well then beside it also at the end
there is a fridge 
uhm 
and er 
well I don't know 
a coffee machine or a espresso machine or something on top of it 
er lots of pictures and
well not lots of but one picture on the wall and er a few
sheets of paper with notes on them 
then 
uhm 
follows 
well a sink and er
yeah well sort of like a s/ s/ small kitchen 
near next to the fridge also on the back of the room 
er a bit further up the wall above the sink there is the
clock 
and uhm 
well if you move to the 
far right corner of the room now there is a
cupboard or a closet 
for 
I don't know 
well maybe cleaning things or something 
then if we move along the 
right wall 
uhm 
we find *another shelf with lots of books this time no magazines and no papers
lots of books and er
yeah well 
registers I guess
uhm 
then moving away from the wall a bit more in the middle of the wall there is a
*a little cupboard 
uhm 
but it's not attached to the wall in anyway it's free it's standing free in inside the room 
on it there is
well there are lots of things again there is a 
bouquet of flowers and then
er some 
sweets 
on a plate 
and yeah some 
other 
well a discman I think or something
uhm 
well if you imagine yourself standing in front of the cupboard and then you
move 
to the left 
well I can actually show you if you're standing in front of the cupboard and then you move to the left
uhm 
you see a couch or a sofa 
with lots of stuffed animals on it 
and uhm 
actually this er couch is out of function there's a
uhm 
well 
something to divide the room up because 
the the closet that I talked about before is in the far back and between the closet and the couch now there is ca plant so that you cannot really see the closet that much
which er makes it 
well which gives the couch er the plant or both of it the function of dividing the room up
a bit 
well and in front of the couch 
uhm 
you find a 
little coffee table 
with er 
playing cards and
cups and coffee on it 
and uhm 
well I think basically that's it 
so I now moved around the room from
the left 
going along the walls to the right corner of the room and then moving in
inside into the room 
after 
okay 
well I have to wait for for the instructions 
oh this room 
oh okay I I thought it would be a different room that will be *sh/ or would be shown 
oh just this room okay
how all right ah 
okay 
so Biron this is the room 
I'll be telling you about bit what 
it looks like so at first yeah
you got several windows but uhm
actually it's *g/ not very light in here 
as you can see probably and uhm 
okay well let's first start there's a desk with a computer so
on top there is a monitor and uhm
the whatever quite sure
uhm there are also some different kinds of other things just like the telephone 
and the mouse 
a cup with pencils 
sheets 
pens in different colors
yeah you also have some living 
elements here just like 
the plants as you can see I guess
so besides uhm 
yeah 
those plants there's a calculator as well
you've got scissors you got cutters 
everything 
pretty much that you could need for doing 
whatever 
anything that you would like to do 
I guess 
and what's also uh quite important but actually *mo/ rather for adults and for young people is that there's coffee standing over there
I guess you know that this will 
wake you up a bit *su/ at sometimes but I guess it's not quite suitable for young people 
as you are 
okay *yo/ so besides this you'll have *f/ 
or you have the fridge 
I don't know what's actually inside but
I 
could reckon that there'll be 
couple of 
some nice things just like let's say milk for the coffee for example 
yeah next to the fridge you have
the 
tap 
where you can just wash your cups and
whatever prepare meal maybe 
whatever you might take out of a fridge for example
and what's also 
quite practical is that 
uhm 
you'll have 
uhm 
bins just under the tap 
so 
you don't have to walk a quite a long way for 
throwing away things well then 
so 
you also have couple of glasses over there and some cups 
as you might see maybe and 
plates 
tissues 
fork knives 
and whatever 
so 
I guess you could just spend a couple of time here and besides this I see 
some empty bottles of whine actually 
yeah 
to go on there's this sofa over there as you can see with
couple of small animals 
just like 
the eagle or the little cow 
maybe you would like to take it into 
or as you want maybe you 
might like to sit down and just give 
a hug o the animals
and there's also on the table uhm
game with memory or off memory *wh/ where you play cards and you have to figure out where exactly
two of the same cards 
are 
showing the same picture 
well and there's also a little rabbit from
Eastern 
might be a bit old now but I guess you could still eat it 
if you'd feel like it 
and have a look at this lovely 
picture of the pirates as you can see
so 
you also move the pirates and make them doing things whatever they are like
yeah then you still got some more flowers just like this sunflower over there and some leaves from uhm
one special kind of 
tree 
and 
there's a scissor and some other things you might need for sewing
and uhm 
and a 

trophy actually 
so that someone might have been good in doing some things whatever they might have been like 
and of course what's still there as we are in a university here 
there's this big 

oh yeah the big shelf over there where you can find all the those different folders 
with all those 
data taken from any experiments like this 
and uhm 
yeah 
have a look those lovely books over there
I guess all in all this is
a room where you could actually feel quite comfortable in
yes 
so just have a look around 
again so show you everything 
take one of those lions or those lollies over there
yeah and that's pretty much about all I guess 
hi Biron 
my name is
nice to meet you 
you'd like to hear more about this room here
would you'll be introducing or showing to 
children 
yes 
okay 
we'll start by taking a little 
walk around 
I'll tell you what's on 
these tables 
so we can 
tell the children where they have to 
touch them or not 
now the scissors 
we don't want them to touch that 
they are dangerous
we've got a torch there as well
which will help em if the lights fail
and we've got some biscuits which they will love I am sure
okay 
uhm 
oh and there is a nice
story book down here for them as well
oh no it's not a book it's just a picture 
my mistake 
okay what else do we have oh 
a little 
mini disc player 
for music I am sure 
uhm 
oh and some 
sewing material 
but the children would not want to use that anyway because
they will get their mother to do it 
oh and the flowers 
the flowers are lovely
very colorful 
so and if they want to play we've got some toys here for them a little dog and an elk little cuddly toys 
but 
they are not allowed to put their feet on the sofa 
not allowed to do that 
and well they would not really want a cup of coffee and say they prefer 
a glass of orange juice or something so 
we wouldn't offer them that 
but there are some playing cards there are picture cards they can play memory with maybe
and of cause they 
the chocolate 
rabbits 
which they can eat
now 
I don't know 
ups 
would better take the matches away because they might
play with the candles we don't want that it's a bit dangerous 
yeah 
what else can I explain clear 
all 
computer 
it says please don't touch it so
I presume the children won't touch it 
the telephone well I am sure they all know how to use that except they are probably more used to using a handy nowadays
more flowers 
oh paper where they can
do a little bit of drawing and coloring 
very nice 
oh and little smilies 
oh more scissors we will put those away
oh 
some playing cards 
they can play memory with this as well
it's the ordinary numbers 
and these are little 
oh is it a game of solitaire or something 
I'm not so sure about that 
and a mini chess 
I don't know how to play it myself
oh and all the 
comic books and
no not so much comic books but
educational books a part from superman 
he'd be more of a comic
coffee machine 
we have here as well which is
they shouldn't really 
be using 
so it should be a little bit putted out of reach
and then there is a fridge 
well 
they don't really need to go to that 
and of cause the sink 
for doing the washing up 
and a nice plant 
so I don't 
really know 
want more I can tell you 
how you would explain it to them
nothing more 
or have you any suggestions 
okay 
touch them 
okay 
well we have got some toys here as I said
you are listening 
we have got a little elk here
now that is sweet
that'll be nice for a very young child
because there is nothing really dangerous on it 
except for the eyes maybe 
buff 
I think it's safe enough
and the duck as well
it's sweet
oh 
those are funny
I don't know what they are meant to be but they are funny 
and if they want to eat something they have got some little chocolate 
lady birds are
oh sorry what ever you call them there
cups for their drinks
and this a toy 
oh is this a radio or what
no I am not sure so 
you would have to ask somebody else about that 
oh 
they should not be touching these 
those are too dangerous
so you tell them 
not to touch anything 
like this 
in fact we can even put them away
but 
I'll leave them here for the moment
but when the kids come you'd have to put them away
and a cup 
from win winning a race 
oh god 
well 
anything oh here is more stuff 
which is dangerous 
campus 
we can't let the child children 
go to that 
and there is nothing in there 
oh 
more tacks 
don't want them under
I don't know who left these lying around but you have to
tell them 
not to touch them we'll put them away
oh oh oh oh oh 
this all much too dangerous for children
and I am sure their parents have told them already but 
these are much too dangerous
away with them 
and down here we've got a *microwelle 
microwave 
it should not be down that low either
I think to be doing nothing but giving out about this 
but 
so 
those books over there
and files over for the
adults not for the kids 
no 
but I mean they can play safely on the floor there is nothing really there to 
hurt them or get at them except just the fact of putting 
candles and things up high and away
and there is lots of postcards here for them to look at
from all over the place they didn't joy seeing some of those 
some of them are amusing and others are just 
places all around the world 
beautiful places 
mhm and recipes 
not bad 
well 
I don't know what else I can really tell you 
that's just my bit of advice it was more negative 
than positive 
but 
you have to look after little kids 
because they don't always know what they are doing 
mhm 
I think that's about it 
mhm 
okay 
so just talk to this thing and and yeah okay 
Biron 
hello Biron my name is Alex 
and er I am gonna show you around this room 
and 
I hope I'm gonna recognize all the plants that are standing here because I cannot probably cannot recognize them anyway
okay so we'll start first of all 
maybe from the right 
so uhm 
at this point 
you find a computer 
which for kids especially your age
I mean kids of years of seven or something like that 
is of course very interesting because its 
it's a good resource of
playing and stuff 
and then we move on well there is a chair of course
and 
then we find a telephone 
and we find lots of pens 
and uhm 
also what we find is a 
little pocket knife for example
and 
on the desk 
there are flowers 
more flowers actually there is flowers and
little green trees here in the back
and uhm 
there is even more pens so there is lots to play with and lots to
lots to er 
paint with 
and uhm 
we find something that I can't really name but it's probably 
a little game here a wooden game 
er and stickers 
and uhm 
s 
a bridge game so a card game to play with
and 
then also a mini chess game that I didn't know
existed 
and a little 
thingie I don't know how to call this but it makes
sounds 
and also there are scissors 
and another 
board game 
that we find here
then in the back of this room 
behind me 
there is shelves 
with 
lots of 
confusing 
computer science magazines 
as well as 
drawing magazines for
uhm 
for uh for uh kids 
and a superman comic 
er in addition we find another plant which is sitting on a stool here on a wooden stool and we find a microwave 
as well as 
uhm 
a fridge and a coffee machine 
which is ready to go but you might not be interested in that 
and uhm 
we find more cartoons on the wall 
and 
which is something which is like a little kitchenette
here in the back where you can 
wash dishes and 
you know 
keeps things clean 
what else do we find we find a 
we find a clock on the wall 
and uhm 
drinks 
down here somebody had a/ 
apparently had alcohol 
and uhm 
eventually there is a nice and cozy sofa 
with a tiny 
teenie tiny table in front of it 
and there's lots of things on the sofa 
let's see 
there is a cuddly animal right here which is
which is a little bird 
and then 
we also 
uhm have a cow and a moose 
and what looks like a hedgehog 
as well as duck and two thingies that I cannot really name
on a table 
er down here in front of the couch we find
two mugs for coffee or tea
and then we find 
what looks like a memory game 
with old women 
on on this on the picture side 
as well as an easter bunny 
a chocolate easter bunny 
and uhm also easter eggs or
basically candles in shape of easter eggs
and whatever that is I don't now it's probably a remote control for a 
some kind of toy 
maybe it's also a radio I don't know 
could be both 
oh 
maybe it's actually the remote control for this little car here 
it's probably 
the case 
and then this is a teapot or a teakettle 
which contains tea which is cold
and er on this side we find more shelves 
uhm 
including 
including a whole lot of 
files and folders 
uhm as well as conference proceedings the way it looks like
uhm 
which is nothing you would be interested in uhm
and another 
little tree in the back behind the sofa 
uhm 
as well as a fire extinguisher in the back
and a broom on the wall 
a little basketball 
basket 
on top of the shelf 
and let's go to this shelf then
uhm 
this little shelf standing right next to the sof/ uhm yeah right next to the sofa 
uhm 
holds a 
pocket 
light 
as far as it looks like it 
and 
in addition there is a 
oh 
oh 
cup for the for the Finnbahn meeting that apparently this department won
uh 
a quite a while ago 
and uhm then there is lots of candy and cookies 
which is really important because it's yummy
and more flowers 
artificial flowers however
uhm 
and some 
minidiscs 
uhm for uhm 
an an min/ 
as it looks like
a minidisc player 
a bunch of needles and other sewing material for some reason
uhm 
and a wooden 
a wooden 
well 
egg-shaped like 
piece of decoration 
and 
one final thing 
I'd like to mention 
which might be interesting for you 
is 
this little magnet/ 
it looks like it's magnetic
yes it is magnetic
a little magnetic board 
with a pirate ship on it 
and lots of pirates and little other thingies that you can attach to the 
uhm 
to the board 
and uhm 
yeah sort of on the board 
what else is in the room 
aside from me and my bag 
did I miss anything 
there's lots of post/ er lots of postcards on that side
from all over the place 
people have been traveling a lot here 
and uh 
I think that's it 
do you want any more explanations any 
okay 
okay 
uhm 
hm 
well I forg/ maybe f/ f/ forgot the binder on this side
there is binders and lots of paper 
here 
and uhm 
we found we had the microwave
I haven't looked into the fridge 
well it uhm 
aside from that there is of course 
in the bag here if we want to *g have a look in the kitchenette again 
uhm 
there is lots of 
uhm 
cleaning stuff for uhm
er for the dishes as well as more or less cleaned dishes and cutlery 
and uhm paper towels 
uhm 
tea bags 
of course as well 
and loose tea as it looks like
as well as sugar and sweetener 
uhm 
and I've 
and a list 
which says that
whenever uh 
whenever somebody has to clean no actually ex/ exchange the filters for the coffee 
uhm 
and I think

hm 
hm 
yes 
okay yes 
okay Biron 
okay 
this is the room I'm going to show to you
now this is the living room 
this is the kitchen 
and this is the working place 
okay 
hm we're going to start here there are some interesting things 
now 
here are cookies and chocolate 
children like cookies and chocolate I like them too
and uhm 
here is some sewing stuff 
like there are needles 
and scissors 
so if you're 
pants or anything are broken you can sew them here 
uhm 
this is I don't know
uhm 
a 
md-player 
you can play music here 
and listen to it 
with this thing 
that's very nice for children too 
oh what is this 
there are pirates and their ship
maybe you can play this with children
now here 
uhm this is some tea 
you can 
put it in a cup 
for the kids and they can drink it 
and with these matches 
you light the candle down here
and then the tea 
becomes hot 
now what is this 
I don't know 
this is a toy for boys
here is a little car 
and with this 
you can run the car 
by pressing the buttons 
there is more chocolate here
oh and a chocolate bunny this is for easter
this is a nice game for kids
it's called memory 
because you have to memorize the pictures 
and there are always two pictures 
that have the same 
thing or the same face on them and you have to find them and remember where they are 
now here are some animals 
maybe 
they are more for girls to play with them 
there is a big raven and an elk 
some small animals 
very nice 
now what is this 
this is maybe for for very small children
they are very soft
*you can lay them everywhere
here is the kitchen 
with a tap you can get water
hm 
so 
here you can get water 
you can wash the dishes because they are dirty 
here are some fresh dishes 
you can take water 
and here you can make coffee if you like but children don't like coffee 
so you don't need this for children
uhm 
no you can not cook in this kitchen there is no cooking place 
but there is a fridge 
you can put things in to keep them cold 
like this is a picture of the inside of the fridge 
this is a tree 
and look here are some nice magazines for children
like this is for children
it's a drawing book 
these magazines up here are not for children
hm 
hm 
now here are some more games 
this is a
chess computer maybe 
I don't know if children can play this 
hm oh some nice stickers here
they are for girls rather
to stick them somewhere
and there is some drawing paper 
and here are some very nice pencils 
very colorful pencils 
so what's this oh even more pencils 
and this is very nice paper 
you can take the scissors and cut something out here
and *then you can stick it 
to another paper with some glue I don't know if you have some no
no
hm okay 
hm oh there is a little pocketknife 
you have to be careful you can cut yourself it's a knife 
so this is not for little children
oh and here is a I don't know
you can take this for
giving water to the flowers 
they need water 
oh and the telephone 
you can call somebody if you like and talk to them 
now what else 
this is a
little thing for playing some music
you can try this 
oh there is another game here
now what else 
that 
is a microwave 
okay 
you can 
put things in there to make them hot 
here 
for example a cup of coffee when it's cold 
you can make it hot 
now 
hm hm hm 
oh this is a flashlight 
if it's dark you can put it on
and you have light 
you can point it somewhere
then you can see 
this is very interesting too
it's a trophy 
it's from the Finnbahn-Meeting
so somebody 
won this because they ran very fast
and then they got this trophy 
and they are very proud to have it 
uhm 
what is this 
this is from wood
and I think it's just a pretty thing
to lay somewhere 
hm 
what else 
this is the *garbages 
you have to take it out if there is a lot of things in there
you don't want anymore 
mh 
these are my things it's my jacket 
I layed here 
hm what else 
oh 
this 
hmh 
this is a comic book 
a comic book 
kids like to read this 
because it has many pictures and you can see what you read
there're 
pictures to every sentence you read 
so this is very simple to read
hm 
oh this is nice
you can see through this 
*ts a very thin paper 
mhm 
very thin paper 
and you can put it 
over another piece of paper 
and looks very pretty 
because you can see 
both kinds of paper oh look there is something on the back too
you always have to look on the back because maybe there is something else
this is the d/ door 
there are many papers on the door they say you must not come in
okay 
hm 
on no the poor cow fell over
oh look 
this is
the instructions 
they tell us how to use 
this little car 
maybe it's hard to use
playing with the car 
oh and there are some more candles 
they have the shape of eggs
so I think they were used for easter 
because for easter you look for eggs 
you also light them 
with the matches 
oh and now I think 
I know what this is for
here you can er put this 
with a car and play with it you put it on the street or in the floor 
and the car 
drives around them 
now I think 
this is a memory that has only faces
so this is probably not for children because 
they won't know all these persons 
okay 
hm oh 
there is sugar here
hm 
hm 
there is sugar 
and there is tea 
and you can make some tea if you like
so how do we do that 
you just take hot water 
and a clean cup 
and a tea bag 
and put it in the cup then you have tea
now here is a towel for drying
the cups after you clean them 
oh and there is coffee down there look
okay 
okay hello my name is

okay so will start here 
so as you can see uhm 
swe have 
shelves here with many books 
and files 
uhm 
here 
we have a small 
er wardrobe small cupboard 
and er we have some biscuits on the table 
and uhm

thank you 
hi I'm and I'm gonna show you this room right now
so you come in here 
and uhm 
well over here you see a bookshelf 
with a lot of uhm books of course
and over here is a little uhm 

and we have like a little chocolate on top and uhm
discs and flower to make the room a little nicer
there is like a picture down here
of a pirate boat 
we got a couch over here so you can sit down and relax
and there are stuffed animals 
on there that you can play with 
in front there's a table 
with a game and cups and tea 
and a couple candles 
and a little easter bunny a chocolate bunny 
then uhm well this is like a little kitchen 
with a sink 
and uhm 
a coffee machine 
and uhm we have a *frigerator 
and like 
all you need in a kitchen like 
silverware and plates and cups and glasses 
stuff to clean your dishes
uhm 
yeah down here is the trash 
there are uhm there's a flower over here
and a flower over there to make it more uhm
to make the room look nicer
then there's another shelf over here
which has a lot of magazines 
and uhm 
on the bottom there's a microwave and cups 
and coffee and I think the uhm
bottom shelves belong to the kitchen area over here 
uhm on this side you see the desk 
and it has uhm
pens and paper 
knives 
uhm 
stickers and another game
and a card game 
like an arts and crafts area 
there are more flowers on the desk too
there is scissors 
and colored pencils 
there are keys 
and uhm 
a telephone of course
and 
every desk has a computer of course 
nowadays 
there are a lot of postcards on the wall 
from different countries 
like Mallorca or 
Barcelona 
San Diego 
with a lot of pictures of those areas 
even one of the National Park in Sequoia 
yeah 
that's the chair of course
mhm 
okay hello Biron 
uhm my name is 
and uh I am responsible for introducing you this room today
which you wanted
to see 
as you can see 
this room is
about 
ten square meters 
with uh lots of office 
material and 
some eating stuff and some 
uh 
decoration material let's start from my right hand side if you like 
uh this is our desk and on the desk you can see a flower 
sorry two flowers 
in a vase which is red
uh next to the telephone and there are some crayons 
and some papers 
uh I think they are for the experiment 
and uh 
some pens scissors 
and a pot for watering the plants 
by the way we have two plants here on my uh right side again
one of them is
a little bit 
bigger than the other one 
and one of them is on the
table and the other one is on the 
uh and behind those plants there is a book case with some books and documents and magazines in it and I can also see uh some
children books there about pirates
or 
Egypts or monsters 
and there are also some 
scientific magazines about computers 
okay 
yeah sorry 
and behind me the coffee machine 
on the fridge 
uh I think you can also make cappuccino and cacao with it and uh other hot
drinks 
which is very practical for this room 
and uh here you can see the sink 
with some dirty cups next to it 
and some washing material and detergents and sugar 
and uh 
here are also the clean cups if you want to drink coffee you can use those clean cups 
and uh over the sink is a clock 
which shows the time which is five past two now
and uh on my left hand side 
is a couch with some stuffed toys on it 
I can see birds a
cow 
a deer 
a hedgehog 
and 
two strange animals which I don't know
and uh behind the couch is a big plant I think it's a palm tree 
and uh behind the plant there are two book cases with lots of folders 
and organizers and some books about psychology
uh most of the organizers are grey but the books are in different colors but
there I 
as far as I can see they are very well organized according to
their types and colors 
and next to the couch uh there is a TV table but there is no TV on it instead uh there are different
materials 
uh there is a red vase with a sunflower in it 
and uh there is a walkman and
there are scissors 
a thread and
pins and needles 
and some cookies 
oh and on the 
TV table there is a poster with a picture of some pirates in it
uh but 
the 
pirates are
like stickers on this picture 
I think this is also designed for a children
and in front of the couch there is a
coffee table 
actually it's a box which is used as a coffee table
uh 
and on this 
box coffee table there is a piece of
paper about the experiments there are some photos 
some of the photos are in a box and some of them are
lying on the table on the table close
and there is an empty cup 
and uh there is a toy car 
a 
rabbit 
which is made of chocolate and some Eastern decorations
eggs uh
yellow and purple 
and 
tea 
uh when I come back to the right hand side uh 
I think there are things which I 
didn't 
tell you at the beginning for example 
uh there is a chair next to the desk on my right side
uh and also there is a ruler 
and a 
a 
big note 
book or an organizer 
and some colorful papers 
next to the crayons which I talked about
before 
and a over the 
table uh there is a column 
with lots of postcards on it 
and I can see different countries in the postcard 
s 
like Mallorca Instanbul 
or uh some countries which I don't know I think Paris 
New York 
uh 
the way the room is organized
is that it's not really full with
too much furniture and uh 
the windows are not
blocked 
by book cases or tables so you can use make use of the windows 
in order to get light or to 
get fresh air 
and there are plants which uh
give a friendly atmosphere to the room 
and 
I don't know what else I should say 
mhm 
one more thing which I uh skipped on my left side is a 
old microwave oven 
I think they use it 
when they want to eat here and 
that also explains why they have a fridge in the room 
so I think 
when they are too lazy to go to the cafeteria or when they want to have a quick lunch 
they can use the fridge and the microwave 
and 
uh on my right side again 
which something which I skipped is a fire extinguisher 
and a 
brush over it so that's
gives a kind of security to the room 
oh 
I don't know what else I should 
s 
say 
well 
well my impression about 
the room is that
there are young people here because I can see uh lots of 
cookies 
and a couch 
where you can sit with 
toys so I have the impression that 
somebody 
sits here and 
uh has a cup of coffee and has 
chats or small talks with friends 
uh and also I can see a lot of dirty cups so that explain that's uh
probably shows that a 
number of people were here to have a coffee or tea 
and uh here is a list uh with names on it uh which shows
who uh 
should 
change the filter in the coffee machine 
so that shows me that there are 
more than 
there 
uh are more than one people in this room 
so they have organized uh the tasks in the room 
like 
c 
washing the cups or changing the filter
and uh 
and the 
books 
in the 
book shelf 
shows 
show me 
that 
there is something about children 
going on here 
because I can see children books or I can see a superman or
novel about someone calls Sarah 
uhm 
and the crayons and the stuffed toys 
are also a part of this 
so far I can say about 
the 
inside of the room 
now I can talk about the outside of the room 
when I look out of the window I can see the 
so called garden of the university 
with the glass roof over the university hall at 
the entrance 
uhm 
so I said so I said under this glass roof there is a 
there is the university hall and 
opposite me is 
uh *anoth/ 
another 
part of the building or a column of the 
building 
uh 
which is I think 
uh designed for 
teacher training 
and uh 
right opposite me is the longest corridor of the university 
which goes through different faculties 
uh 
as I said the 
room has a friendly atmosphere
because of the lights and the decorations the flowers
the toys 
mhm 
what I can say 
what 
I can also say is the lights 
I cannot really say that the lights are friendly because I can see fluorescent lights reflected by mirrors on the ceiling 
uh 
but 
although it's not really friendly I think it is the 
optimal way to make use of electric energy 
mhm 
mhm 
and uh I can also say that 
owners or the 
people who work in this room 
are 
water drinkers because I can see lots of 
water bottles under the sink 
and I think they are also wine drinkers because I can see wine bottles 
mhm so 
this room 
is 
I think 
a place for working and 
living and having fun and having friends at the same time so it has 
more than one functions 
which makes it 
friendly and 
nice and comfortable so you can work here 
uh you can 
watch out of the window or you can uh 
paint with crayons or
if you have children in the in there you can play with toys or 
uh with sticker books 
or you can have coffee and eat cookies 
and at the same time you can read psychological 
magazines or a 
you can reorganize the 
folders probably
yeah and *al/ 
also uh 
the 
postcards on the column 
or 
show me that the people here like to travel 
because I think 
they got postcards themselves or probably they got it from friends who visited those countries 
mhm 
and 
that's all I can say about the room Biron I hope you liked the room 
I hope everything is clear if you have any questions don't hesitate to ask 
okay 
hello 
hi 
okay 
I'm and I'm going to show you the room 
there is lots of cool stuff to play with 
so hopefully you can show your kids that later 
uh we'll start over here this is the desk 
area 
you've got stuff to make projects with 
uh 
background papers 
markers 
stuff to draw around 
one thing to be careful with is these knives 
if they want to play with the knives you have to make sure that there is an adult around
because they are sharp
stickers 
scissors also
games over here
chess or
card games 
or other 
fun stuff to play with
on this desk 
when you go round the corner 
you have what I'd like to call the reading 
area 
so you have books 
and uhm 
maybe 
exercises 
for crafts for making things 
yeah 
also 
there are comic books 
over here so 
after they get a bit tired maybe you can even 
read them a story 
okay 
uhm 
the kitchen 
in case they get thirsty 
there is glasses 
and probably juice or water 
so uh they cannot 
reach 
for something themselves but it's breakable and it's a kind of high 
so make sure that they are careful 
good 
so this is the cuddly couch 
and there is lots of 
stuffed animals 
so if they want to take a nap 
or 
kind of cuddle with an animal you have them 
yeah so there is *the bird 
and some other little tiny 
animals 
and a couch 
over here in the corner 
uh which is big enough for
three or four kids 
they can sit on there 
and read stories 
or 
play 
with their 
crafts that they made maybe 
pirates or something or puppets 
they can even go behind *the couch and maybe play a puppet game
or make a play 
here is a little table in front
uhm 
with the 
can of tea on top of it 
so I guess you can keep it warm in case there is
parents sit or going to come to peck up their children 
uhm also it's a good place to play card games because the table is really low
okay 
uhm 
on the table there is a remote control car 
it doesn't
work 
uhm 
and there is other things that you can play with here too there 
okay 
next to the couch is a table 
a cabinet actually 
where you can 
put games or books 
and on top of it you have
stuff 
for *sewing 
uhm 
so if you make pillows or do other crafts 
you can 
use the scissors or the thread 
or the needles which are on top of this cabinet 
next to that is an MP3 player 
so if they want to listen to music 
they can do that 
next to the *sewing kit is a bowl with goodies 
so if they are really good maybe they can have a cookie 
or 
a Mars 
bar 
a flash light 
in case the power goes out 
for emergencies or for playing underneath 
when you are playing pirates 
next to the couch 
mhm 
uh one thing to remember in the *sewing kit is also a pair of scissors 
there are seven but they should be careful with that 
okay 
uhm 
yeah 
also in the room are a couple of trees 
really big one behind the couch 
uh which 
probably can't be knocked over so that's okay 
uhm next to the desk in the area where there is books in front of the book case 
is 
a tree on top of a little stand 
which they could knock over
so they need to be careful in that corner 
it's right over here
yeah 
uh 
this one 
okay 
uhm but this one on the table is also a kind of tree
maybe they can play around by watering the plants or even planting new plants
so that they learn 
about growing 
organisms 
but they should 
remember to be careful over here 
maybe they could move it out of the way before they go to the books
okay 
there is also a telephone on the desk here
next to 
all this applies for building and for crafting 
there should be a list of phone numbers next to it in case of emergencies
and uhm they can also unplug it and kind of
play 
that they are on the telephone 
that would be a fun game in here 
other things that I can explain to you is the way that the kitchen 
is set up 
uh there is a sink 
and there is soap so after they play
tea party 
they have to remember to 
rinse out their cups 
and there is also bowls so in case they want to use the cookies on top of a bowl or a plate
there is a bunch of them stocked up over here
in the sink right now are lots of spoons 
maybe they were playing music 
with the spoons 
but they are 
really belong 
on the far right of the kitchen 
in this plastic container 
uhm so whenever they 
play around with them they should wash them 
and put them 
back where they belong 
there is also a large stock of paper towels 
on the far right 
for spills 
which always 
happen 
or for laying under when you are cutting something or for doing a crafting project 
underneath the kitchen 
there is like I said juice 
or water 
stuff to drink 
and very important the trash-can 
so when they have stuff to throw out 
that's where it goes 
on the table in front of the couch is
a memory card game 
with faces on it 
if they wanted to play this they'd have to spread it out on the floor 
okay so this is a memory card game 
yeah that's a game 
there is also other games 
like uh chess 
which you could suggest to the children
I really don't know what else to say 
that's pretty much it 
there is really pretty postcards on the wall 
let's uhm 
right here behind the computer 
and uh 
that's something pretty to look at
or maybe to talk about the different places that 
there are in the world 
or that 
people have been 
okay 
should I maybe 
describe the room more detailed
okay 
good 
uhm 
let's talk about the book case more detailed the specific books that are there that you can suggest
okay and like I said 
you have to be careful on the way to the book case because of a big tree 
in front of it 
uhm 
here in the book case 
there are 
craft 
books 
which you can learn to draw
with 
so uhm the kids can learn to draw an Egyptian 
or a pirate 
or 
a monster 
so that would be something that they could do with the paper that's on
the desk 
also there is a comic book a really big one 
superman 
which they can take over to the couch 
and read 
or they could even 
trace the pictures 
which would be something fun to do 
or just simply 
play out the stories if you have boys here 
yeah 
there is also more difficult stuff to read
uhm 
comics 
which would be fun
alright so that's uh 
basically what you have in a library 
right now 
mhm 
as for a specific 
stuff to draw with you have 
colored pencils 
pens 
and markers 
which are helpful because you can color in or trace around
and uhm 
also Winnie the Pooh stickers and Smiley Face stickers 
so uh maybe when they are really good and they are leaving then they should get a sticker 
okay 
one thing to remember is that there is candles 
on the table 
and matches 
and I don't know if seven year olds should be playing with matches 
uh but I don't think you can light matches 
so uhm maybe 
just let the tea get cold
I would hide the matches but uhm
they are on the table 
so you should *leach 
teach them how to 
be safe 
with matches 
okay and definitely don't let them 
play 
with matches 
okay 
and now I am finished 
okay 
uh hello my name is uhm and I'm gonna show you 
this room here
uhm here you see 
a desk of drawers
uhm you can 
put some 
nice things on it like flowers 
or 
like some uh 
some chocolate or some biscuits 
and uhm 
minidiscs 
all those things 
and in it you can put things like like
books or uhm 
whatever you wanna put in it 
glasses 
and 
here 
we have a table 
uhm 
there are some uhm 
mugs on it you can drink
you can drink coffee or tea out of these mugs 
and uhm we have candles here and a and a
pot of
uh tea 
and uhm 
people can sit at that table because there's also a sofa 
behind it where they can sit on
and uhm 
on on that sofa we have some cuddly toys 
uhm that people might wanna play with
uh or the kids might wanna play with 
and behind the sofa 
there's uhm 
a plant looks like a like a palm to me
a small palm 
and then there is also uhm a big shelf 
with a lot of folders in it 
and uhm 
some books 
uh and uhm let's move over here 
this is the kitchen area 
of the room 
and uhm 
people can make some coffee there 
there's a coffee machine 
or 
get uh uh they can get hot *wa/ hot water from the from the from the 
tap 
and there's also uhm forks knives and and
plates and uh
cups everything they need
if they wanna 
get a tea or a coffee 
uhm 
there is also a fridge 
so if you wanna have a cold drink 
you can get something from the fridge 
and uhm 
besides the fridge there's another shelf 
with uhm some small brushes in it 
and uhm 
again some 
cups and a microwave I *s/ I think yeah there's a microwave in it 
and uhm 
yeah 
some instant coffee 
as well 
and uh 
no 
we move over here 
where we have a table 
uh 
actually it's two tables uh moved together
so that they 
form one table area 
on the table wave once again
uhm we have once again 
a plant 
uhm 
and there is a calculator on it 
and uh some papers 
and 
a telephone 
is there 
uhm and last but not least uhm a computer 
uhm 
there's a chair to that uh table 
so that 
people can sit down 
at the table 
okay 
and uhm 
behind the uh uhm computer 
people have hung up some post cards 
post cards from from holidays
they made somewhere 
uh 
they had somewhere 
uh what else is there yeah down there there's still uhm 
uhm 
garbage buckets 
uhm to put your garbage in 
and that's also the place where where all the 
the empty bottles go
uh 
all right 
uh and I think that's about it 
okay 
hello robot 
uh 
does he have any name 
my name is and I am go you show you this 
ahm apartment sort of
and where the children 
shall go away they should not go where they have problems or perhaps not 
okay here we have 
something like a working-table
uhm 
doesn't understand 
working-table you should ah see that the scissors are opened they should be *sut/ uh shut
because uh 
will be very 
dangerous for the children 
and the other stuff better not to 
touch it 
then uh here we have our library 
in that corner 
and uh 
yes I think 
children may may do with it what they wish to
and we have here 
what's his living room 
living room where the children also are able to play with 
with uh 
some 
how do you call it 
toys 
and here there is no problem you also can see here 
that everything is prepared that so that the children 
may do what they wish 
although you should you should what uhm 
mhm 
if you are able to then then tell them not to touch the the hot 
teapot because it is very hot it will be
hurt some if 
something happens 
here is the kitchen and the kitchen also has
as always 
knives and so so watch it 
uhm 
if they want to take a bath then they should go to the bathroom and not uh stay in the kitchen 
cause the kitchen is for something else
and uhm 
a coffee-machine in the living room also not for children
better not 
and if they want to water the plant and no problem
and here is the working station working-place it's uh
sort of best not to to have the children there because otherwise it will be a total chaos
but here is uhm 
interesting 
there seem to be little *kitch/ children and uhm elder children for the elder children this is the place where 
they can 
do what they feel like they cut paper or 
be creative and there is the the place where 
uhm 
they may 
fiddle around with for example cats or something
I would say 
uh 
what have I forgotten 
that down there is garbage and the garbage better not not uh
to have them 
play around underneath the 
the the the the

on the right hand side of the shelf we have a table 
and uhm on this table 
you have coffee you can drink coffee

uhm 
behind the desk there is a couch 
uhm 
on this couch sitting on this couch you *gan you have uh
different animals er er several animals 
uhm 
again these are not real animals but toy animals 
uhm 
for example you have a 
you have a raven 
uhm a cow 
a duck 
uh this one here is uhm called an elk 
okay 
uhm then we have another 
another uhm shelf here
uhm on the very 
uhm 
this this shelf is is stuffed mostly with uhm stuff to read
different things to read for example uhm 
like comic books 
*ef comic books right here books with a sort of lot of pictures
uhm 
then you have uhm 
more like magazines 
uhm 
not telling any stories but but more with uhm 
yeah its its like the news on on TV 
but in written form 
uhm 
this is a microwave
then the very uhm 
on the lowest levels sorry of the lowest level of the of the shelf you have a microwave a *m * microwave uhm
can be used to uhm 
uhm *heaten up food 
very fast 
food that is already 
prepared you can put into the microwave and then
on the right hand side 
of the microwave then again you have
several cups 
just like the ones that we have seen on the er on the table 
uhm 
this is
a 
well a coffee machine 
uhm 
quite a uhm 
luxurious uhm 
sort of a coffee machine quite quite complicated but 
basically what you do with it is uhm
you use it to make coffee
like the one on the table 
cups again
these are uhm
dirty cups 
those on the table are clean but these are dirty cups and they stand here because
uhm 
here they are placed next to the sink 
hello 
hello 
okay 
they are placed next to the sink and
uhm they can be cleaned
uhm 
in the sink 
this one here
the sink hello
yes 
this here
hello 
and uhm 
then right above 
right above the sink 
you have a water boiler 
that you can use to boil
boil water if you need hot water for example you boil it first 
this can be done 
with with uhm 
this thing over here
you have the 
the the tap 
uhm out of the tap you
get the water 
can turn 
the tap on and off if you turn the tap on
the water pours out of it and if you turn it off again
the water stays inside 
uhm 
these things here uhm that are normally er transparent they are not called
cups but uhm glass 
uhm 
*cops you uhm 
cups uhm are mostly used for for uhm 
uhm 
uhm 
hot beverages like uhm beverage is something to drink uhm uhm mostly alcoholic stuff to drink 
uhm 
a cup is usually used for things like tea 
and hot chocolate 
or coffee a glass like this one here which is transparent
uhm is mostly used for uhm 
er beer or softdrinks water 
and things like that 
uhm then we have uhm 
things here that we er er use for uhm
for eating for for lunch for dinner for breakfast 
whatever we don't er use our hands to to eat but 
but uhm 
we use for example er spoon this is a spoon 
you can use that for for soup
and er generally food that is uhm 
uhm 
more liquid 
for uhm 
for meat and uhm fish and bread and uhm sort of vegetables 
uhm 
we use these two the two *up these *tise fork 
this one's a fork 
and this one is a knife 
er this here
is called a towel 
uhm 
once that you've cleaned up 
uhm the dirty er the dirty cups or the dirty
uhm plates 
the dirty forks knives spoons 
uhm 
uhm there are er uhm 
wet then because you clean them up with water
and you can 
dry them up again with
this thing here this is called a towel 
uhm 
this is a plant 
but uhm this is a real plant uhm the the flower over there were like artificial but this is a
a real plant that you could also find
uhm somewhere on the outside 
these are called pencils uhm
you can use for uhm 
take notes write something down 
or for drawing something 
if you prefer 
if you want to to draw something er or write something down you you not just need a pencil but you also need a 
uhm 
sheet of paper 
like this here
uhm this here is named er bottle 
uhm 
in a bottle er a bottle is usually filled with uhm something to drink 
this here for example uhm
uhm 
is a bottle that used to include uhm
uhm 
orange juice 
but er now it's empty it's empty someone 
emptied it someone
drank what used to be inside of it 
hello Biron I'm 
and I want to show you this room now
so in the right side of the room I start with the
red pillar 
and there you can see many many postcards from I think
all over the world but 
we can have a closer look if you want 
so 
uh 
I can't count them but you can see them so I don't 
explain it 
any further 
and er 
on my 
right side now 
I find a 
long table 
a computer table 
and you have some 
elements 
they're hardware
below the table 
and 
er 
the other the mouse 
on the 
table 
and er 
er 
other 
parts of the computer 
and uhm 
then you have a 
chair 
to use 
with a computer 
and er on the table 
you have 
plenty more things 
used for uh 
office communication you have a telephone 
and er 
uh small 
cup 
with some 
hm pencils and er
other 
instruments 
to write or to 
mark 
some things 
and you have some 
scotch tape 
and er what do we have here 
looks like a small mirror 
but uh 
no 
it's more
glass 
I don't know 
what it is
what it's use
for 
doesn't look like a mirror 
uh 
hm I have no idea 
something to discover
this is some
very useful 
instrument in school
that you will 
use later 
when you are a little bit older 
maybe 
in the year of 
twelve thirteen fourteen 
it starts that you use 
and it's uh
meant to be used for 
er *mattematics 
and you can 
paint with it and
you have even a little 
rubber 
I think 
looks like a rubber of plastic 
and er 
some 
more things to use for 
for school 
subject mathematics 
and 
here we have something to
put papers in 
to 
save them 
then you can use it for work maybe or
if you have painted something you can put the paintings 
inside here 
and put it together 
and put the 
this 
uh 
it's not so
good any more but 
you can use it 
for your 
paintings 
or for other 
papers if you want to save them 
and uh 
on this table you have plenty more things 
you have some very nice 
uh papers for
you can write on them if you want to write a letter for example you can use
the paper in different colors
or if you 
want to 
create your own pictures 
you have a small 
sky 
*wiss clouds for example 
or you have another paper 
with stars 
that looks quite nice I think
*ss/ uh big stars on one side and smaller ones on the other side 
let's have a look if there is more 
so you have 
different colors 
but er 
yes 
another sky 
and and some more stars 
and uhm 
here we have 
other 
*nay/ this is not *tr/
really paper it's harder
and it's also meant to
to make your own 
not painting but er 
to play with it 
to 
you can find out many things 
you can you can see what you 
what you create with them 
maybe 
uh 
your own 
rainbow sky 
or something like that 
I think a rainbow could be good to do with this 
to create 
hm 
then on the 
table we have a small knife 
with some other instruments 
small *scissor 
and something to 
clean your nails 
and to make them look 
pretty 
what else 
small box 
uh 
okay 
with these things you can
fix papers on the wall 
or on a 
uh 
on a pin 
board 
like if you want to leave a note for someone for example 
then you can 
put them on the wall
but it shouldn't be 
a hard wall it should be something soft 
make made from 
cork 
something like this 
and you have plenty of them in this small box 
hm 
here you have some some flowers not uh
real flowers but er
looks nice they look nice
in a red 
uh vase 
and uh 
over here you have more 
uh pencils 
more uh some
more to write with
different colors 
that you can use
to paint 
nice pictures 
what's this 
uh *kay 
this is also a kind of
paper but it's very
thin paper 
and er 
you can nearly look through it 
not exactly but 
looks like so something more to
to invent some 
pictures or to 
I don't know what else 
you can find something to create for I think different materials 
this is 
more hard cover 
and uh 
there 
some more 
of these green 
thin ones 
and some more silver ones 
uh 
this is
very useful instrument I think
if it's what I
think yes 
it's like a
knife 
where you can cut the paper 
so you can put it 
where you want it 
use the 
uh this for it 
and put it here
and cut it 
exactly where you want to have it cut
so that it looks straight
and you can 
cut pieces for example like this one this is a small piece 
that was cut from one of the papers before
and you have 
two of these knives 
and here you have some 
more 
pens 
uh 
school pens 
think 
also in different 
colors 
hm 
and er 
on the end of the table 
closer to the window 
you have something to
uh 
you have some water in a 
kind of can 
to 
give water to the flowers 
because on the 
right side 
of the 
can 
you have a 
a flower 
I think it's a
in German it's called 
in Latin 
but uh it's not so important the name it's just 
that it should have some *flow/ uh some water
mhm 
on the table you can also find a very big scissor 
so you if don't want to 
cut the paper with the
these small knives you can also use a long scissor 
and I think it 
nearly takes all the 
uh 
it goes it cuts half of the paper away
if you want 
mhm 
some more pencils 
let's have a closer look 
yes these are
different types of pencils so
on the table you really have many pencils and
different types of 
roller pencils I think and some
ordinary ones 
colored pencils 
so 
a lot to paint with 
the you have er 
some stickers 
of Winnie the Pooh 
and some smile 
smiley stickers 
so 
something you can
uh 
put on the paper if you want or
stick it somewhere
you've some more stickers some stars 
uh quite many 
golden ones 
hm what do we have on the edge of the table 
this is
a game 
I I think it's something like a
four wins 
maybe it has another name
it er it's made of
wood 
and you have uh 
uh lighter wood and darker wood 
and uh 
small 
hm 
uh it's not marbles it's er
don't know exactly the name of it but uh
hm maybe you know the game four wins and you *her/ should
put 
four 
er pieces 
together 
and er 
try to 
to win the game by putting
four 
one by one 
to the top or 
it can also go 
uh in another *deerec/ direction 
like here you also have four 
or here on the top you also have four 
so it's 
something to try some game to try
and uh 
on the edge on the right edge of the table 
you have another game 
it's called 
and it's uh I think it's a card game 
looks like a card game for the
two to seven player 
but it's 
just up 
er from the age of ten 
but maybe it 
can also be played 
with younger ones 
er 
on the other edge of the table you have a little
chess computer 
has two levels 
er 
you can start 
to play chess 
with it or maybe also to learn chess with it 
hm 
this *lu/ looks like an instrument 
to make music 
it's also placed on the table on the
right side of the table 
and if you 
*s/ turn it round
it starts to play some music
think it's a song from er Frank Sinatra
a old one 
and er 
what else on the table there's also a game 
a another card game 
that er maybe you know it 
and 
and you can even play more 
card games with it 
mhm 
so now we are already 
on the end of the table 
and on that side you just have the window 
and nothing 
else a radiator 
and er 
there on the 
end of the floor there's a little 
old coffee machine 
I guess it's not working any more
and er 
then we 
on the right 
of the table you have a bookshelf 
not a 
a straight bookshelf but it's er
meant to put a 
newspapers or magazines 
on it 
and I think on the 
third 
upper levels it's just
uh literature for grown-ups
some 
hm 
I don't even know what it is
computer 
magazines and
hm 
not so interesting 
magazines I think
engineering 
communication 
magazines something for grown-ups
but on the 
fourth level 
we have something more interesting
for example we have a 
a comic 
called Sarah 
and it's in
black and white 
looks like an adventure comic 
and another one Superman 
another comic 
this is colored 
and then what is this 
hm this looks like a
drawbook drawing book 
this is about
ancient Egypt 
and they show pictures and you can
try to draw them 
and start it starts easily and 
after a while it becomes a little bit more 
difficult 
and they are three of them 
one is about pirates
and this 
ancient Egypt 
and a third one is about monsters
so you can 
there's 
Dracula 
Cyclops 
space aliens 
skeleton 
some 
some monsters 
to draw 
easy drawing 
and on the 
er fifth level from the top 
you have some more 
stuff 
from the university 
some papers 
for the students 
this looks like a microwave 
also 
quite old one 
and on the right side of the microwave you have some cups several cups 
six cups altogether
and on the 
ground 
of the bookshelf you have some more
uh papers and
magazines 
for students 
and some 
other stuff 
this looks like a
uh 
it is er to clean the water
you can put it in some instrument
and it makes the water
clear 
and drinkable 
so 
if the water is much 
*pollyuted/ or something you you can put it in the water and it cleans the water
and er on the right side 
down 
nearly on the floor you
you can find some coffee 
and some 
glass 
uh can 
and another one of
plastic 
and that's all for the bookshelf 
and er in front of the bookshelf 
besides the table 
you find a 
bigger 
plant 
it's also a
like the one on the table 
but it's a little bit
bigger 
and er 
in right of the in 
at the right of the bookshelf 
you have a *fridgerator 
with some 
stickers on it 
er some 
pirates 
and a shark 
and the pirate boat maybe 
and you have a big coffee machine 
on the *fridgerator 
where you can
make 
different 
type of coffee maybe also you can have hot chocolate 
or some tea I don't know 
on the wall 
above the coffee machine you have some
painting 
one painting 
and er 
some 
more small cartoons 
one is from
of Garfield 
and er 
two other 
cartoons or
painted jokes maybe
and there's er some more papers 
at the wall 
how to clean the coffee machine and
more 
not so interesting things 
written on the paper 
and er 
then you have the 
the board to
clean 
er the cups 
and there are some cups and
glasses to clean
and er 
er there's 
water 
er on the wall and
you can 
make yourself some 
coffee or tea 
and er below you have some 
waste baskets 
and er 
on the right side 
up there's some 
some er things to clean
some 
like washing 
cleaning powder 
and er 
yes 
something to clean your
hands and to clean the 
er plates 
and cups 
and you have uhm on the right side 
of this table 
you have er or of this board better you have some
sweetener sugar 
and different kind of tea 
Earl Grey and some 
some more teas 
and this thing 
I think it's for this
water 
cleaning 
what I showed you before there
for a kind of machine 
and you here you some more cups some plates glasses 
some 
spoons knives forks 
and some paper 
to clean afterwards 
or to dry your hands with 
and some 
sugar 
in different forms 
and er 
below the board you have some
bottles glass bottles 
*mine/ of mineral water 
and some 
empty wine bottles and
champagne bottles 
whatever 
oh 
and er 
now we come to a more interesting 
part this is a
big sofa 
with some 
some small toys 
some 
little 
some small friends 
this looks hand-made
you can play with it and there's something
something in it I think it can be some
kind of corn 
in it 
wheat or 
something in that weigh 
and here we have some more friends 
looks like a 
uh it's a big bird with a
big mouth a big throat 
and a small cow 
and er another 
animal that you
may know from the 
it lives very
far up in the north 
and er some more 
animals 
this one you know
I'm sure it *li/ er it's in a
lives in the lakes 
a duck 
uh this one I forgot the name but it's 
er 
you can find it 
sometimes in winter 
it's a
you shouldn't touch his hair it 
because it 
can hurt you 
uhm 
and on the 
in front of the sofa 
you have a small table 
with some more things on it 
a small 
car 
small sports car 
and this looks like a
you can 
use it to move the sports car but I'm not
sure if it is but there's also
some instruction 
yes it's for this small car 
that you can 
make it run and go around
you have another cup and you have a
small 
rabbit of chocolate
and some more small 
animals of chocolate
and you have matches 
and you have a pot of tea
and some candles 
can see 
another cup on the other side
of the table 
this looks like a
that could be used for the
car 
some 
some small 
er 
uh I don't know the name er 
you can put it 
er you can create your own street 
and then it er hinders
the car to
go straight so it you can go round in curves
with the car 
mhm 
and on this side of the table you have a small
card game 
a memory 
so there are 
people 
faces 
of women 
I think it's only women 
and uh 
I'm sure you know memory 
so I don't have to explain it any further 
you you should put the two 
pieces that fit together you should 
put them together 
mhm 
so the behind the sofa 
you have a big tree 
uh looks like a tree it's a plant as well
but it's really big so it looks
more like a tree 
don't know 
what it is but
it er covers little bit of the sofa so if you sit
there on the 
end in the end of the sofa you can have maybe
some leafs 
on your head you can feel them 
in your hair 
on the right side of the sofa 
you have another small 
it's a
it's a cupboard so you can
put some things in it 
and er 
in front of the cupboard 
we have a 
uh 
a picture 
made from 
hard paper 
and it's a a pirate boat 
on the picture 
and there are some stickers 
the same stickers then we have seen on the *fridgerator
and they 
are sticked on that paper 
I can see many pirates 
and 
uh 
there's a 
treasure 
box 
and some cannons 
cannonball 
and a card to find the treasure 
mhm 
and up on the *car/ er cupboard we have some more things 
we have some 
plastic 
flower 
and leafs 
leafs I think 
and we have some 
hm mp3 it's called I think
it is
you can use it you can
put some 
music on it and listen to the music
on this small 
instrument is
to make 
these mp3 play
and to 
play the music 
this belongs to the
mp3-player 
small 
instrument to 
make it play
and er 
here we have a lot of needles in a small box
so 
you can put things on the wall with it 
fix them 
uh like er some paintings or 
post cards or 
maps 
and besides we have a 
er some more things 
we have another big scissor 
some needles sewing needles 
and something more to sew
different types of 
and all is put in uh on a 
small 
it's not a plate but it's 
something to
put things in

looks like a 
uhm 
uh I've forgotten the name 
uhm 
it's an animal that comes from 
that lives 
some live in the water 
and they 
in the sea 
and they come up on the beach to put their eggs 
and then you have 
small ones after a while and the small 
animals try to get 
in the water again 
er maybe I 
remember the name later 
hm 
and you have another 
thing made of wood
uh I think that is er 
no 
looks like a cover of something
maybe it belongs
to the animal 
could be 
and on the right side of the cupboard 
you have a lot of sweets 
some cookies and other things 
and er 
what is this 
looks like a small lamp 
yes I think it's a pocket lamp 
mhm 
and on the 
end 
of the small cupboard 
you have a 
a heavy thing 
it's a
price 
that was won for a
for a race 
for a university 
race 
it is called meeting
and the winner gets this 
price 
mhm 
and on the right side 
of the room

and it's full with
books 
and with folders 
to put er papers in 
and you have 
one two three four five six levels 
and

big bookshelves and you can find
uh a lot of

there are 
books you can color

over here there are many postcards 
up there 
and uhm 
I think that's it 
hello Biron 
hello Biron 
if he reads me he should actually 
make some face 
I'd like to show you this room 
in this room 
we find for example 
chocolate 
this 
is chocolate bunny 
many children like chocolate bunnies 
or here we have little chocolate bugs 
actually not to be found in the English-speaking area but 
they taste good
additionally there is some tea 
now it's cold
but you can make it warm and it tastes better
then 
if you'd like to follow me 
we have a memory game here
you probably know the game 
Biron 
you have to find matching pieces of the puzzle 
uh to make points 
it's a pretty large one so it's hard for seven-year-old children 
then we have some toy animals 
we have a duck 
we have a hedgehog
we've got some kind of 
moose or
the like 
we have a cow 
and a raven 
or maybe a crow 
uhm additionally 
to talk more about sweets 
we have some cookies in this shell 
additionally with some lion bars 
this uh
is some kind of uh 
torch light 
I guess 
and uh 
well this is obviously of no real use for this experiment
it is very important 
Biron 
there you go 
it is very important to not let the children 
near these scissors 
Biron 
what are you looking here 
uhm 
these are scissors and they are very sharp
where are you looking at Biron 
*p/ please try looking at me 
uhm 
and also here are needles which are also very sharp
and the children 
might take damage when playing with them 
furthermore we have some flowers 
and a minidisc-player 
so if the children want to play some music 
just show them where the minidisc-player is
uhm 
all right now we come to the work place 
if you would be so kind to follow me 
this is the work place
maybe not very suitable for 
Biron 
hello Biron 
Biron 
would you be so kind to 
direct your gaze to me thank you very much 
uhm 
this is the work place
in which uh the children might surf the Internet if they are able to and 
have the like 
or have the uh want to 
and on this work place 
we see a telephone 
some flowers 
and oh this is very nice
uh the children 
can play with these papers 
and with these cutters 
but you should advise the children that they must be careful with these cutters cause also
they are also sharp
as well as the scissors 
uhm 
also we have some stuff to draw
many different colored pens 
and a game 
which I consider
a little bit difficult for children 
but it's still a great game 
uh further games included mini-chess computer 
your little 
uh 
colleagues so to speak 
and a card game 
and here we also have some stickers you should be
sure not to let the children 
with those 
cause they might stick them to you
uhm 
this is a chair 
where the children could rest
as well 
as on the couch 
couch to rest chair to rest
uhm 
if the children 
get thirsty and they do not want to drink the tea 
you might invite them 
to drink some of the water available here 
there are a lot of uh 
dirty cups 
but I'm sure the children don't mind because there are clean ones too
uhm 
what else is there 
here we have a little flower I don't know the name of this 
but uh you should make sure that the children don't throw this over
uhm okay one item I forgot
or did not speak of is this because I do not know what it is
uhm 
well 
and I still don't know what maybe children 
do know and want to play with it 
and if they want to they can find it here
one more item is very dangerous for children
which are these *madgez/ matches 
uhm 
but actually 
I consider if *ch/ uh it okay if children are old enough to know what they are and what they do 
should let them play with them 
but still 
make sure they don't do anything dangerous 
uhm 
I guess that's about it I think you're ready to show the children the room 
uhm hello Biron

when you have a piece of paper 
it doesn't matter whether thick 
paper or thin paper 
you put it on the table 
you 
put 
the ruler on the
piece 
a piece of 
paper 
and 
you 
take a pen 
and now you can draw straight lines 
you have 
to 
touch 
the ruler with
the 
tip 
of the 
pen 
but I don't want to do this now 
in order not 
to 
make 
any lines

together they are a pair of scissors 
you hold them like these
if you are left-handed 
if you are right-handed you hold them like
like this 
and you can cut paper with them 
like this 
and now you have 
to 
pull the 
the 
thumb 
and the f/ middle finger 
together 
and then you 
cut through the paper 
so this was the watering can I already told you
here you can fill in water 
like this 
you go to the 
tap 
and 
uhm 
turn the 
the 
knob 
and fill in water 
I hope you can see it 
as much as you want 
but only until its 
nearly full 
and 
if you want to water plants 
you have 
to 
move the watering can like
this 
the that this 
end 
moves 
downwards 
the water will come out here so if you want to water plants 
you can do it like this

the shore 
of an island 
this is 
the island 
this

boat 
these are the pirates

h/ who 
rob 
other boats

is on a wooden 
wooden 
uhm 
on a wooden 
wagon 
with wheels 
it has wheel 
wheels on the front side and bo/ 
and also on the back side 
but you can't see them 
and 
on it 
there is the bomb 
on the back side you have 
to 
put 
in 
a thick 
ball 
and on the front side it will 
come out 
and with this you can bomb other boats 
so that 
they 
uhm 
so that they sink into the sea 
because 
the wood 
gets holes 
can I open the cupboard 
no 
uhm 
this is a cup 
remember I told you this was also a
cup 
and also 
this 
and this 
these cups 
they are 
all made 
of 
porcelain 
or 
uh no they are made of 
made of China and they have a handle 
this where I put me fingers through 
fingers through is the handle 
this is quite a different cup 
first you don't drink out of it 
second 
it's made of
heavy metal 
and it has a
a stone foot 
and there's a sign on it 
made of 
made of a certain 
uhm material 
a it says 
meeting 
this is the cup 
which you get when you have participated
in a sport's 
competition 
and when you have won 
when you were the winner 
the winner always 
gets a cup 
and 
it looks like this 
or very similar 
and 
on this sign 
it will always say 
what kind of competition it 
was 
and who was the winner 
or in which year he was the winner 
okay 
this is the torch light 
the torch light is
uhm something similar
as a 
uhm a lamp 
like 
the lamp 
up there 
can you look 
at the ceiling 
uhm 
a lamp always 
gives light 
and a torch light also does 
it's called 
torch light 
because it has
the shape 
of a 
torch 
a torch is also long and thin 
and you 
press this 
button 
and then it 
makes light 
you see 
it's not very bright this 
one 
to switch it off
you 
press again this 
button 
oh and if you press this button 
it makes a light like that
the light always moves round in circles 
mhm 
to 
mhm turn it off you again
press 
this 
button 
okay 
these are biscuits 
you can actually eat 
them 
you just 
take them 
into your hand 
open your mouth 
and put them into the mouth
and then you chew 
and then you swell 
uh 
mhm 
and you 
swallow 
sorry that was wrong 
right 
my name is 
uhm fourty-two I'm a secretary working at 
the University of Bielefeld 
faculty of linguistics and uh 
I will describe this room now where I'm in
starting 
at the door 
uhm 
the door with a black handle
and uhm 
it's like a grayish color typical door all the door have the same color in in this building
so uhm 
right next to the door is a bookshelf in the bookshelf 
*lows of files and books 
uhm I don't know what they are about but
look all like technical stuff to me
and er right in the middle of the room 
there is 
a like a little sofa little sofa its beige colored
behind the sofa 
there is a big plant 
and next to the sofa 
has like little 
well 
is like a little *shrank type I think 
and on it there is uhm
oh quite a few items 
so let's see 
uh 
this one here
looks like a 
whatever flashlight I don't know
yeah it's like a torch 
obviously 
it's black and it's got a silver top on it has got two buttons 
and one 
makes it 
like a flashing light 
the other one is like a permanent torch 
okay 
now we have got a bowl full of biscuits lovely biscuits 
and a few chocolate items in there as well
all nicely laid out with a napkin underneath
and 
these two wooden items here
this looks like a little
tray 
it's empty there is nothing on it 
and this tray is
made of wood as well it's a turtle shaped one
and there is a sewing kit in there
er with needles 
and scissors 
and thread as well
uhm so there are some other needles here
and 
not so advisable to touch it cause it's quite dangerous you can injure yourself or hurt yourself *badly
uhm then there is a 
oh I don't know what this is
it looks like a little recorder thing
uhm I'm not sure 
could be a camera 
I'm not sure about that 
there is a few discs 
these discs are all several all different colors
orange red 
silver type 
and turquoise 
also there's *n pretty flowers they are artificial and not real flowers 
but they are nice
and some leaves 
they feel like when you touch them they feel like paper very soft paper
they're in a pretty little vase in the red one
okay uhm 
I touched the doors of this little *shrank 
there is uhm it looks like a piece of a book but it's not it's about pirates pirates on a ship 
just see 
oh yeah and there *are magnets you can move them around shift them and place them where you like
there is a big pirate 
seems to be the boss 
okay so 
then mo/ we move on to the sofa 
on this sofa 
we've got all these cuddly toys and they're really pretty
there is this big raven here I think I've seen it on TV before
with a big big mouth 
*s'pose you can put your hand in there as well oh yeah 
so you can make it talk
open the mouth 
big eyes 
and some funny feet 
and that one 
sits right in the corner 
and there next to it 
there is a cow with a little bell on
looks just like a swiss cow 
oh and also it probably makes it does make some noise sounds like a duck to me not like a cow but maybe I'm not so familiarized with the new ones nowadays anyway 
so and there is a moose 
*is one of my favorite animals the moose 
uhm 
we always have lots of moose 
as a decoration at winter time when it comes to Christmas 
but of course they are always pretty to have em around and actually its got a Christmas 
bow 
on as well 
and it's a soft toy so they're really cuddly they are really soft material 
very nice to take to bed with I suppose 
to cuddle up to 
and there is this hedgehog here
uhm 
almost looks like self-made but it's not it's a puppet as well 
can put it over your hand and it can talk you can move the face
and the feet as well it's really cute then it's got orange eyes 
black nose 
and it's lovely furry
nice to cuddle 
in the corner 
is the duck 
and I suppose this makes a cow noise now yeah I see so they 
put them in the wrong animal 
so this one makes the cow noise shouldn't do it but
anyway it's part of the fun 
okay 
on top there is some other animals whatever they are they look like self-made
they're really funny got long hair
they're like Beany Babies
little beans inside so 
you can put them 
you can make them sit up
like this or lie down 
and there is a red one 
and this is more
well 
*kinda blue 
I would say 
bit of purple color 
okay 
behind the sofa or let's move onto front of the sofa first
it's more interesting I *s'pose 
there is 
a cup 
blue and white quite heavy actually 
so if you fill it with a drink it gets even heavier
there is a uhm 
um well 
it looks like a teapot but I think it's been used for coffee
the coffee pot it's not hot at the moment
but you always have to be careful with tea- or coffeepots as *you probably know 
there is a light underneath a candle 
three candles in front
they are probably left over from easter
there is two boxes of matches here which er
can be quite dangerous 
and children shouldn't touch it really without
an adult being around and even then they have to be super-careful 
okay what else do we have here oh and some ladybirds chocolate ones 
hm *yumm *yumm probably lovely 
and a 
little bunny chocolate one as well
uhm this is a oh this is cool
this is a remote control car 
there is a remote it a little racing car 
I not gonna try this now cause I'm not very good with these 
otherwise it's *going to go all over the place 
and what else do we have 
and this is
a mini racer charge 
probably for the car but I can't tell you
what you can use *em to but I got to do with the c/ do with the car 
and then is this memory game I've never seen anything
like it I know a lot of memory games
but I've not seen this one 
it's all about women I suppose
I suppose let's see yeah this is famous women 
and it's a
typical memory game 
and I can see 
uh 
I can't tell you who this is 
then we see 
some very very ancient pictures 
of some royal families 
this looks like Ghandi to me
Indira Ghandi 
here is Marylin Monroe I suppose a lot of people know her
very pretty actor 
who died a long time ago 
here is the matching one to that one 
this one I'm afraid I don't know her 
and there is Kathryn Hepburn another very famous actor
and what else do we have 
Marylin Monroe again
this one I don't know the English name for her 
is Kathryn Hepburn 
okay 
suppose this is a very difficult game to do
but 
not for young children *cause their memory is still very very good 
alright what else 
this table is quite low I think it's made of a cardboard box
but to make it a little nice a little nicer it's got a tablecloth on top
which is blue and white
and it feels like
really thick cotton it's very nice
right what else 
behind the sofa is a like a little kitchen 
small kitchen 
with 
uhm a few dirty dishes 
few glasses mugs 
paper to dry your hands with
some washing up liquid cleaning liquid sugar sweetener 
or things that *you need to make uhm some tea or coffee 
there is some tea here
different types of tea English tea 
Twinings earl grey a lot of people like that 
plum tea 
uhm 
here right by the sink 
there is one two three four five mugs and four glasses 
and on top of that there is
well its like a water kettle 
*you can 
warm you water up in here tea or make you some tea or coffee or 
you can also just use it for washing up
but again 
this can be very dangerous *cause it gets very very hot
boiling hot and if you get that over your hands 
*it can cause you blisters all over 
right to do the washing up er here is the washing up liquid and two sponges green and blue one 
and a little brush as well
there's a tea towels 
just been hang up to dry 
*onto this *sink which you probably can't see from there uhm
this two bins for the rubbish
a crate with
uh mineral water 
and a box with a few
uh empty 
uhm bottles in there
then next to it there is like a really professional coffee machine coffee maker 
uhm 
yeah where you just have to put the cup underneath 
and then press the button 
and the coffee comes out which you probably have to put in somewhere on the top 
and it all stands on a little white fridge 
on the fridge there *is a few pieces which
probably belong 
to the pirates pirate game 
which I just showed you before
which is onto on this little *shrank here on this little locker 
and somebody took it of there
to play with it on the fridge 
okay what else 
*this is a very 
very small picture on the wall 
which shows a cracked bottle of champagne in a freezer 
uh next to it is another shelf 
very plain but nice wood 
with a few magazine in there
also for children 
one is about monsters
that looks really interesting to me kids can draw monsters it says
right 
it shows you all the different ones like this one for Halloween
there is a happy monster it looks nice 
this is a spooky one a little ghost 
vampire 
that be cool 
space alien 
werewolf oh wow it gets really dangerous skeleton

pirate again 
with a parrot on his shoulder like we know them 
and so on 
there is another one about superman but I not gonna take that out now
okay that is another pretty plant here on that *little stool 
what else uhm we can move on to this desk here now
in the corner 
this is mini chess game I'm afraid I can't play chess 
but 
*s a computer chess game 
is for 
very clever children I suppose 
this is a bridge 
card game 
*this is inside here 
okay 
it seems to be complete *s got the blue
and the red *back 
and there is a little thing 
uh what should I call it again

okay I don't know that one 
they have a *mine there is a game here
something about no fear
it's another card game 
alright 
and this one this game here how to play but I've seen it before in a
in a Chinese shop 
a little wooden 
single pieces but I don't know how to play that one 
this one here is a leftover from Christmas obviously it has got little stars on it 
you can put these on presents
or on a car to make it look nicer 
there *are some drawing pens here
these look really nice they got all different colors
yellow 
orange pink green light blue and dark blue 
and some more crayons here
think 
yeah okay 
colored pencils they are not crayons 
and there *is two knives here
uhm 
you can use those to cut out
pieces of paper cardboard actually
uhm 
they have got a security lock normally
you can push them out only with one finger with your thumb
and use it to cut out 
uhm bits of paper 
stars hearts whatever shape 
but they are very very sharp and uhm
you should be v/ very careful when you use them actually
you shouldn't use them without an adult being around
there are some more scissors we already talked about scissors how dangerous they can be there is a little pocket knife here looks like a swiss knife
okay very sharp again 
a dangerous item 
that you better not touch 
and just leave on this 
okay it looks nice and it's very tempting to use it I know but it's very very dangerous
okay there are some more 
all sorts of colors loads and loads in here 
and there *also is nice really really nice paper you can use
to make 
whatever little *puzzles little boxes 
just to cut out the flowers which are in *n one top of it 
and this is nice cardboard as well it is one with clouds and stars on it oh this reminds me of Christmas again
and it is really warm today so it is not really Christmas time 
okay what else do we have here this is a funny shaped one it feels funny
has got like little waves on it 
all sorts of different really pretty colors 
okay what else do we have a ruler 
just an empty folder here
so once you've done all your drawings or cutouts you can out them in the folder 
so they don't get lost 
and there are some pins 
and again 
these might hurt when you touch them wrong the wrong way
so 
better not use *thas 
okay there is another flower here two flowers 
almost white 
a little beige colored in uh in another red vase 
which is uh very slim
sort of looks more like a bottle than a vase but it's pretty
but they are artificial again they feel like paper very soft paper

robotic magazines 
this is 
this 
is 
the entertainment table 
uhm 
on the entertainment table 
you have lots of different 
things 
to 
play with 
lots of things to play 
like 
you have a small 
mini chess computer 
which is uh
if you just use this 
probably quite hard to use 
it's not easy with this because you can't 
see very much what you do 
but uhm it's 
it's a mini chess 
computer 
there are other games like a 
this game is called
it's in a box
this game is in a box
it has a
lots of different 
small playing cards 
similar to trading cards in it 
and uh some chips 
I don't know what it works out 
maybe you learn how to work it out 
okay 
it's called 
it's a
game 
in german language 
here we have something to make music with
if you 
use it 
you get a small little melody 
which is very / repetitive 
this makes
music the small iron machine 
next to the mini chess 
and 
the game 
is 
the small iron 
music machine 
behind 

is a different very small plant 
very small plant 
accompanied 
by 
uhm some kind of 
water s/ 
device 
uhm 
it's to give the / the plants in this room water so they grow
in front of 
the 
plant 
and next to 
is a small thinking game 
probably / 
yeah 
some thinking game I don't know how it works
it might be very interesting but uh it's made out of wood
this game is made out of wood
it's light and dark wood 
then there's another
card game you can play Skat or or lots of other things with
but maybe uhm 
Skat or uh 
are 
most well known here 
and you've stickers you can
these 
on this paper these are stickers 
next to 
the cards 
and the wooden game 
so it's with a 
Winnie the Pooh sticker and Smiley stickers you can
you can stick 
these 
pieces somewhere and they stay
then there is a 
different colored pens 
yeah 
different lots of different colors it's 
jell ink 
pens 
and 
Gel FX colored pencils 
so you can 
draw or do what ever 
art you want to do 
do a lot of art 
with these on a
quite 
interesting paper if you want to see
you probably can't see but never mind 
uhm 
yeah 
oh I was 
probably 
probably I was 
too far away 
I was too far away I guess 
uhm 
okay sorry Biron 
now I know 
these are again uhm
knives 
these are small cutting knives 
for 
yeah 
to use 
to use with the stronger paper 
lying here on this table as well
stronger paper with patterns on it 
this is
paper 
right this 
this 
the form 
paper I don't if you 
probably can't calculate I guess it's 
too complicated never mind 
and 
front it has patterns
this special pattern 
if you understand has a 
big stars 
on one side 
and on the other side small stars 
but the small stars are lot more plenty 
there's more patterns like clouds and what ever 
and we've another pair of scissors 
to cut the paper 
yes you cut the paper 
or you cut uhm 
this is
not real 
normal paper this is uh
yeah this is 3D texture
texture kind of uh on top 
it's 
a wave texture 
it makes it look very interesting
and uh very nice to to combine it 
with glue to to other things here and maybe 
to make a card or what ever with it 
there's a lot of 
plants 
because here we have another 
two flowers 
there are not real they are plastic again
but they are very nice
first you look you don't recognize them being
being not real 
okay can you / 
can you can you follow 
no you can't 
programmed to stay there 
okay 
so 
normally 
if you work 
on this 
on this table 
or if you play on this table you maybe sit down
on this chair 
there is this 
chair 
on wheels 
before 
uh in front 
there's a chair on wheels in front of the table 
you can sit down 
and work very comfortable 
you can for example 
take this 
small folder 
take the small red folder and put
paper inside
so 
after you worked the paper you could
put it inside
or 
you take the paper out again
and then 
maybe 
you take a pen 
you take a pen and draw 
you draw 
every most 
pens have a lit
for different work you can use this computer which I'm not going to use
uhm 
uhm 
but you could use 
it has
a keyboard 
this is a keyboard 
a mouse 
which is very movable
and a monitor maybe this doesn't belong to the game
uhm 
so 
there's 
it's a computer this is the screen the big thing is the screen 
it's 
behind 
the 
keyboard 
and 
normally I look 
on the screen 
to work 
I look on the screen to work
okay 
do we forget 
oh 
we go back 
to 
this 
to the sink 
underneath 
the 
underneath 
the sink 
is 
dustbins 
dustbins are very important
you put uhm all the 
things you don't need any more the trash 
trash you put in the dustbin 
and you don't want to see them normally so
you just 
put them far
under the table 
so 
I don't know 
I forgot now when I started 
because I run of materials so maybe I rather 
probably though it's early 
I don't know if you learned a lot 
yeah so I maybe quit 
so 
goodbye Biron
