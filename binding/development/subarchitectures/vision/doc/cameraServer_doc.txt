\section desc_cameraServer Description

\p CameraServer is a managed component.
It provides information about
internal and external (= 3D pose) camera parameters
by updating and writing 
the \p Vision::Camera struct into working memory.

The initial camera parameters can be set
using configuration files. 
Once set, the internal parameters are normally constant.
However, the external parameters will vary
when the platform on which the cameras are set 
(e.g., \p StereoHead, \p Manipulator) has moved.
Triggered by the 'overwrite' of \p Vision::Head (a struct
containing information of head poses) in working memory, 
\p CameraServer will update the external camera parameters 
and write \p Vision::Camera into the working memory. 

\section conf_cameraServer Configuration

CPP GD <name> CameraServer [options]

\b Options: \n

--calib <file> .. camera calibration file (internal camera parameters).
                Mandatory. \n
--camnum <num> .. camera number (e.g. 0 = left, 1 = right). Defaults to \b 0. \n
--eyepose <file> .. pose calibration file: camera pose w.r.t. "head", which can 
                  be a stereo head or a manipulator hand.
                  If the camera is fixed (not mounted on any head) this pose
                  is just the camera pose w.r.t. the world origin.
                  Defaults to identity. \n
--headnum <num> .. head number (e.g. 0 = stereo head, 1 = hand) \n
--headpose <file> .. pose calibration file: head pose w.r.t. world origin.
                   In case the head never moves, its pose can be specified
                   here. Defaults to identity. \n
--downsample <num> .. downsample factor, optional, default \b 1 \n


\subsection  calib_cameraServer Internal Calibration File
The calibration parameters are based on 
the pinhole camera model: <b>m = A*(R*M +t)</b>,
where \b M is a 3x1 world point (mm),
\b m a 3x1 image point in homogenous coordinates.
\b A a 3x3 camera intrinsic matrix, \b R a 3x3 rotation matric,
and \b t a 3x1 translation vector (mm).

The file provided for \b calib option 
must contain: \n
fx <num> : focal length in x-direction (pixels) \n
fy <num> : focal length in y-direction (pixels) \n
cx <num> : x-coordinate of the principal point in pixels \n
cy <num> : y-coordinate of the principal point in pixels \n
w <num> : image width in pixels \n
h <num> : image height in pixels \n
f <num> : nominal facal length in mm \n
k1 <num>, k2 <num>, p1 <num>, p2 <num> : distortion parameters 
\n \n

The files provided for \b eyepose and \b headpose
must contain: \n
r : a 3x1 rotation vector representation of \b R, where
the direction is the axis of rotation and the length is angle in radian. \n
t : a 3x1 translation vector in mm.
