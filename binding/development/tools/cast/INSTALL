Installation
--------------

CAST requires:

* g++ (part of GCC, tested with v 4.3.2). On Ubuntu install package g++.

* Sun's Java JDK, preferably version 6. On Ubuntu install package sun-java6-jdk

* Cmake version 2.6 or above. On Ubuntu install package cmake.

* Apache Ant. On Ubuntu install package ant.

* Ice version 3.3 or above for C++ and Java. On Ubuntu you can install the packages libzeroc-ice33-dev and libzeroc-ice-java.

* Boost version 1.35 or above. On Ubuntu you can install the package libboost1.35-dev.

* Subversion (as all our code is stored in svn repositories). On Ubuntu install package subversion.

On Ubuntu, you can just try something like:

sudo apt-get install g++ sun-java6-jdk cmake ant libzeroc-ice33-dev libzeroc-ice-java libboost1.35-dev subversion

It is important that the the Ice.jar and ant-ice.jar files installed
by the Ice java package are included in your classpath. You can add...

export CLASSPATH=/usr/share/java/Ice.jar:/usr/share/java/ant-ice.jar:$CLASSPATH

... to your .bashrc file, or similar. If you have multiple versions of
Java installed on Ubuntu you can use

sudo update-alternatives --config java

... to select the correct installation.

1. Untar the cast-*.tar.gz file. We'll call the resulting directory
$CAST_ROOT. Change into that directory:

2. Edit $CAST_ROOT/build.xml so that the "install.prefix" property is
where you'd like to install CAST on your system.

3. Compile the Java elements of CAST using ant:

ant build

This should produce a directory output/classes under $CAST_ROOT which
contains all the Java parts of CAST.

4. Install the jar file:

sudo ant install

This will copy the file cast.jar to <install.prefix>/share/java for
later use.

3. Configure the C++ parts of CAST using cmake. Do this creating the
$CAST_ROOT/BUILD directory, changing into it, then running ccmake on
the directory above:

mkdir $CAST_ROOT/BUILD
cd $CAST_ROOT/BUILD
ccmake ..

ccmake is a cross-platform tool which produces makefiles which we will
later use to build CAST. The command will produce a GUI window with a
number of options. The default values should be fine, unless you wish
to change CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to be a different install prefix. This should be the
same as you've used in build.xml. To create the build files press 'c'
(to configure the build files) until you are able to press 'g' (to
generate the build files). If you encounter errors, follow the
instructions in the error messages to fix them.

4. Once you have configured the build with cmake you can build and
install CAST. Do this by changing to $CAST_ROOT and running make
install within the build directory:

cd $CAST_ROOT
make -C BUILD 
sudo make -C BUILD install

If this completes successfully, the file <install
preix>/bin/cast-server-c++ should exist. If this does exist, then CAST
is installed!


5. Configure your system environment to find CAST. This means
including <install prefix>/bin in your PATH, and
<install.prefix>/share/java/cast.jar in your CLASSPATH.




Running
-------

To run CAST, run 

cast-server

on all the machines you wish to run components. Then run

cast-client <cast file>

on one of these machines.

Note that these commands have changed from the previous names.



Common Installation Errors 
----------------------------

If ant exits with an error like:

BUILD FAILED
/tmp/cogx-code/build.xml:53: The following error occurred while executing this line:
/tmp/cogx-code/build.xml:24: The following error occurred while executing this line:
/tmp/cogx-code/tools/cast/build.xml:12: taskdef class Slice2JavaTask cannot be found

you most likely forgot to set the CLASSPATH so that it include the location of ant-ice.jar (please see top of page)



If you get compilation errors like:

compile:
    [javac] Compiling 280 source files to /tmp/cogx-code/output/classes
    [javac] /tmp/cogx-code/tools/cast/src/java/cast/CASTException.java:14: package Ice does not exist
    [javac] public class CASTException extends Ice.UserException
    [javac]                                       ^
    [javac] /tmp/cogx-code/tools/cast/src/java/cast/AlreadyExistsOnWMException.java:33: package IceInternal does not exist
    [javac]     __write(IceInternal.BasicStream __os)
    [javac]   
    ...

you forgot to add the path to Ice.jar to your CLASSPATH (please see
install step 5.)
