The MARY TTS system has now been installed in $INSTALL_PATH !

Now, to run the system, you need to start TWO programs:

1. The MARY server
   The server is the core of the system, doing the actual work.
   A shortcut for starting it should have been created for you on your desktop.
   You can also find the program at $INSTALL_PATH/bin/maryserver
   
   The MARY server will verify the integrity of the installation prior
   to startup. If it detects a misconfiguration, it will report it
   and refuse to start. It may also propose to download a missing component
   from the internet.
   When you see a message like the following, you can proceed to step 2:
   "Mary server 3.x.x starting... started in 3.51 s"
   
2. The MARY client
   Start the MARY client to convert text into speech.
   A shortcut for starting it should have been created for you on your desktop.
   You can also find the program at $INSTALL_PATH/bin/maryclient

   The MARY client will fail if no MARY server could be found. Make sure your
   server was correctly started prior to starting the client!
   
   Of course, the MARY system can be used in various client-server setups,
   e.g. for web applications. See $INSTALL_PATH/examples/client
   for a number of implementations in various programming languages.
   
There is a lot of tweaking possible, and much to be known about the insides
of the MARY TTS system. A good starting point for knowing more is the README:
$INSTALL_PATH/README.txt

Have fun! :-)
