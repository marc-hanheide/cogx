Interconnectivity 
=================

The "interconnectivity" package provides functionality for multi-level and cross-modal process interconnectivity. The aim is to provide general functionality for context circumscription, content association and convergence, and synchronization.

DOCUMENTATION
=============

SYNCHRONIZATION MODELS
----------------------

We represent synchronization constraints as a state-based model. In
this model, a state determines indicates which processes may carry out
tasks, whereas state transitions are conditioned on either (a)
data-items being added to working memory, or (b) time-outs being
reached.
