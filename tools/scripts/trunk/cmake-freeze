# This script will create an initial cache file for cmake from an
# existing CMakeLists.txt. The script will search for CMakeLists.txt
# in the current directory and in the directories BUILD, Build and
# build. The results will be printed to standard output.
#
# Only the variables of type BOOL whose name contains BUILD
# are processed.
#
# Example:
#    cd BUILD
#    ../tools/scripts/cmake-freeze > frozen_settings.txt

# Absolute path and directory
#SCRIPT=$(readlink -f $0)
#SCRIPTDIR=$(dirname $SCRIPT)

   # GREP explanation:
   #    when a variable definition is encountered:
   #       - print preceding line (B 1)
   #       - print line
   #    In this case grep will add '--' after every match so we delete it in sed
   #
   # SED explanation:
   #    when line starts with --
   #       delete it
   #    when line starts with //
   #       merge next line (N)
   #       extract: '// ' (comment) '\n' (variable) ':' (type) '=' (value)
   #       replace with: 'set(' variable value 'CACHE' type '"' comment '"'
   #    The last two expression will handle entries without comments and empty lines
