   - The PTZ server now includes a GUI that is managed by the Display Server.

   - The PTZ server also monitors the movement of the PTZ and updates the UI
     every time an end-of-motion is detected. The motion status (Still/Moving)
     is also displayed in the GUI.

   - The PTZ server accepts 2 parameters:

      --motion_tolerance "0.01"   // minimum distance that is detected as movement
      --move_ptz_deg "pan tilt zoom" // move to initial position, in degrees

      The motion tolerance is specified in [deg/s]. The server monitors the
      frequency at which it is running (this is reported in the INFO view of
      the Display Server) and adjusts the tolerance to match the frequency.
      This should detect movements at the same precision independent of the
      frequency at which the server is checking the position. Normally it
      should be checking at 10Hz, but when the Gazebo simulation is running on
      the same computer, this drops below 1Hz.

      The PTZ in Gazebo simulation is never stable. Because of this the
      tolerance should be set to 0.2 when using a simulated PTZ. For the real
      PTZ the default 0.01 should do.

   - The Ice interface was extended with the function isMoving().
