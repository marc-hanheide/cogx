   - The PTZ server now includes a GUI that is managed by the Display Server.
     The PTZ GUI was previously managed by the SOI Filter.

   - The PTZ server also monitors the movement of the PTZ and updates the UI
     every time an end-of-motion is detected. The motion status (Still/Moving)
     is also displayed in the GUI.

   - The PTZ server accepts 2 parameters:

      --motion_tolerance "1e-2"   // minimum distance that is detected as movement
      --move_ptz_deg "pan tilt zoom" // move to initial position, in degrees

      The motion tolerance is specified in [deg/s]. This should detect
      movements of at the same precision independent of the speed at which the
      server is checking the position. Normally it should be checking at 10Hz,
      but when the Gazebo simulation is running on the same computer, this
      drops below 1Hz.

   - The Ice interface was extended with the function isMoving().
