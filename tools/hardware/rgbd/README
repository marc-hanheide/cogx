hardware/rgbd

Place for all current and future RGB-D camera server code.

Currently there is a server for Microsoft Kinect sensor.
Note that for this to work, you need OpenNI unstable branch (check it out at openni.org) and SensorKinect fork of PrimeSense Senso from here: https://github.com/avin2/SensorKinect
KinectPushServer operates very much like Odometry and LaserScan push servers.
There is a test component under .../src/c++/test and a corresponding cast file for quick checking your sensor.

In the future as new RGB-D devices appear more push servers can be implemented under the same folder.
