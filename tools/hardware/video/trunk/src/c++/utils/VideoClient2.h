// An instance of a CImageReceiver will install an ICE server to receive images
// from a video server.
//
// CAST server discovery is done through CAST which discovers servers by the
// cast-id of the component that creates the server. This means that only one
// image receiver can be created per component.
//
// A component library can create only one active component at runtime, so
// a CImageReceiver can only be known under one address (component-id).
// Thus it makes sense to implement CImageReceiver as as singleton.
//
// The receiver will dispatch the received images to registered instances of
// CVideoClient2. There can be at most one CVideoClient2 instance for each
// VideoServer used in a CAST configuration.
//
// A CImageReceiver is not meant to be used directly. Create instances of
// CVideoClient2 instead.
