  - The Kinect object is now properly locked: a single instance is used by the
    components KinectPCServer and KinectVideoServer; this fixed the bug which
    made every other Kinect frame invalid (and caused system crashes on the review).

  - The frequency of calls to readFrame() is limited to 20Hz.

  - A better palette is generated for the RGB depth image; this image can be
    obtained with PCClient::getRectImage(-1, ...); the camera id (-1) may change in
    the future.

  - Inlined the functions DepthToWorld and WorldToColorInternal.
    Grabbing of points is now approx 20% faster.

  - Most of the code for the person detector was moved from KinectPCServer to
    Kinect; this code has to be tested.

  - New functions for conversion of depth image to RGB or GS.

  - The RGB depth image can be shown in the display server.
