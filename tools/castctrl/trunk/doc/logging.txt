To configure the logging levels for individual components, create a text file 
(eg. logs/loggers.ini) with the logging levels of individual components. The 
file is an ordinary dos-ini file where each section represents a 
subarchitecture and each property in a section represents a component:

   [<subarchitecture-1-id>]
   <component-1-id>=LOGLEVEL
   <component-2-id>=LOGLEVEL

eg.:
   [vision.sa]
   videoserver=WARN
   videoviewer=FATAL

The valid log levels are: ALL, TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL

An empty section can be used for special logger names or if you want to
specify the full name of the component's logger:

   []
   my.special.logger=DEBUG
   vision.sa.stereoserver=INFO

The empty section is the default section and is used if no other secitons are 
specified. The ini file is read sequentially so multiple sections with the same
name can be used.

In Cast Control enter the path to the in file into the 'Levels' field in 
'Logs'.  The settings will be appended (with a prefix) to the log4j.properties 
file for clients (logs/cctmp.log4client.conf). the above examples will generate:

   log4j.logger.vision.sa.videoserver=WARN
   log4j.logger.vision.sa.videoviewer=FATAL
   log4j.logger.my.special.logger=DEBUG
   log4j.logger.vision.sa.stereoserver=INFO
