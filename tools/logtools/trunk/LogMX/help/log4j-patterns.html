To create a Log4jPattern LogMX Parser, you just have to give LogMX the <B>Pattern</B> you used to generate 
your log file. This Pattern can be found in your <CODE>log4j.properties</CODE> file, in a line
similar to:<BR>
<BR>
<CODE>
<SPAN style="background-color: #F7EDD3">log4j.appender.FILE.layout.ConversionPattern=</SPAN><SPAN style="background-color: #ECD5AA">%6p (%F:%L) - %m%n</SPAN>
</CODE><BR>
<BR>
In this example, Pattern is "<CODE>%6p (%F:%L) - %m%n</CODE>".
<BR>

Following content is an extract of Log4j documentation, which can be found at 
<A href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs/api/org/apache/log4j/PatternLayout.html">
http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs/api/org/apache/log4j/PatternLayout.html</A>.
This document describes how such Patterns are constructed, and its syntax: you can use this 
Pattern syntax to describe any log format, not only log files generated with by log4j.

<B>Note: </B>LogMX calls 'Tag' the union of a <I>conversion character</I>, its optional
<I>format modifier</I>, and its optional <I>precision specifier</I>. Example of tags: 
<CODE> %-20c{4}</CODE>, <CODE> %d{HH:mm:ss,SSS}</CODE>, <CODE> %p </CODE>.

<p>The conversion pattern is closely related to the conversion
pattern of the printf function in C. A conversion pattern is
composed of literal text and format control expressions called
<em>conversion specifiers</em>.

<p><i>You are free to insert any literal text within the conversion
pattern.</i>

<p>Each conversion specifier starts with a percent sign (%) and is
followed by optional <em>format modifiers</em> and a <em>conversion
character</em>. The conversion character specifies the type of
data, e.g. category, priority, date, thread name. The format
modifiers control such things as field width, padding, left and
right justification. The following is a simple example.

<p>Let the conversion pattern be <b>"%-5p [%t]: %m%n"</b> and assume
that the log4j environment was set to use a PatternLayout. Then the
statements
<pre>
Category root = Category.getRoot();
root.debug("Message 1");
root.warn("Message 2");
</pre>
would yield the output
<pre>
DEBUG [main]: Message 1
WARN  [main]: Message 2
</pre>

<p>Note that there is no explicit separator between text and
conversion specifiers. The pattern parser knows when it has reached
the end of a conversion specifier when it reads a conversion
character. In the example above the conversion specifier
<b>%-5p</b> means the priority of the logging event should be left
justified to a width of five characters.

The recognized conversion characters are

<p>
<table border="1" CELLPADDING="8">
<th>Conversion Character</th>
<th>Effect</th>

<tr>
<td align=center><b>c</b></td>

<td>Used to output the category of the logging event. The
category conversion specifier can be optionally followed by
<em>precision specifier</em>, that is a decimal constant in
brackets.

<p>If a precision specifier is given, then only the corresponding
number of right most components of the category name will be
printed. By default the category name is printed in full.

<p>For example, for the category name "a.b.c" the pattern
<b>%c{2}</b> will output "b.c".

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align=center><b>C</b></td>

<td>Used to output the fully qualified class name of the caller
issuing the logging request. This conversion specifier
can be optionally followed by <em>precision specifier</em>, that
is a decimal constant in brackets.


<p>If a precision specifier is given, then only the corresponding
number of right most components of the class name will be
printed. By default the class name is output in fully qualified form.

<p>For example, for the class name "org.apache.xyz.SomeClass", the
pattern <b>%C{1}</b> will output "SomeClass".

<p><b>WARNING</b> Generating the caller class information is
slow. Thus, it's use should be avoided unless execution speed is
not an issue.

</td>
</tr>

<tr> <td align=center><b>d</b></td> <td>Used to output the date of
the logging event. The date conversion specifier may be
followed by a <em>date format specifier</em> enclosed between
braces. For example, <b>%d{HH:mm:ss,SSS}</b> or

<b>%d{dd&nbsp;MMM&nbsp;yyyy&nbsp;HH:mm:ss,SSS}</b>.  If no
date format specifier is given then ISO8601 format is
assumed.

<p>The date format specifier admits the same syntax as the
time pattern string of the <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html"><CODE>SimpleDateFormat</CODE></A>. Although part of the standard
JDK, the performance of <code>SimpleDateFormat</code> is
quite poor.

<p>For better results it is recommended to use the log4j date
formatters. These can be specified using one of the strings
"ABSOLUTE", "DATE" and "ISO8601" for specifying <A HREF="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/apidocs/org/apache/log4j/helpers/AbsoluteTimeDateFormat.html"><CODE>AbsoluteTimeDateFormat</CODE></A>, <A HREF="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/apidocs/org/apache/log4j/helpers/DateTimeDateFormat.html"><CODE>DateTimeDateFormat</CODE></A>
and respectively <A HREF="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/apidocs/org/apache/log4j/helpers/ISO8601DateFormat.html"><CODE>ISO8601DateFormat</CODE></A>. For example, <b>%d{ISO8601}</b> or

<b>%d{ABSOLUTE}</b>.

<p>These dedicated date formatters perform significantly
better than <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html"><CODE>SimpleDateFormat</CODE></A>.

<p>The location information depends on the JVM implementation but

<p>By default the relevant information is output as is. However,
with the aid of format modifiers it is possible to change the
minimum field width, the maximum field width and justification.

<p>The optional format modifier is placed between the percent sign
and the conversion character.

<p>The first optional format modifier is the <em>left justification
flag</em> which is just the minus (-) character. Then comes the
optional <em>minimum field width</em> modifier. This is a decimal
constant that represents the minimum number of characters to
output. If the data item requires fewer characters, it is padded on
either the left or the right until the minimum width is
reached. The default is to pad on the left (right justify) but you
can specify right padding with the left justification flag. The
padding character is space. If the data item is larger than the
minimum field width, the field is expanded to accommodate the
data. The value is never truncated.

<p>This behavior can be changed using the <em>maximum field
width</em> modifier which is designated by a period followed by a
decimal constant. If the data item is longer than the maximum
field, then the extra characters are removed from the

<em>beginning</em> of the data item and not from the end. For
example, it the maximum field width is eight and the data item is
ten characters long, then the first two characters of the data item
are dropped. This behavior deviates from the printf function in C
where truncation is done from the end.

<p>Below are various format modifier examples for the category
conversion specifier.

<p>Below are some examples of conversion patterns.

<dl>

<p><dt><b>%r [%t] %-5p %c %x - %m\n</b>
<p><dd>This is essentially the TTCC layout.

<p><dt><b>%-6r [%15.15t] %-5p %30.30c %x - %m\n</b>

<p><dd>Similar to the TTCC layout except that the relative time is
right padded if less than 6 digits, thread name is right padded if
less than 15 characters and truncated if longer and the category
name is left padded if shorter than 30 characters and truncated if
longer.
