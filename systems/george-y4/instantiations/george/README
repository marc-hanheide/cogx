The files in this directory define the George Y4 system.

The main file george.cast and its includes define all the components that can
be used in the system. Individual parts of the system can be turned on and off
with settings in the variables 'hardware', 'hardware_options' and
'feature_options' with the defaults on top of george.cast. The main file should
be modified only if additional components or component parameters are added.

To run the system, select one of the run-george-*.cast files. These files
change only the variables used for the configuration of the system and add no
components. Create more such files if necessary.

The files are prepared for running in simulation. To run on the real robot,
change the value of the variable 'hardware'.

For distributed execution a .hconf file has to be used in Cast Control or the
cast file has to be modified.  The hosts are now defined in george-hosts.incl.
To create your own distributed system, copy the file to
george-hosts-<username>.incl and modify the HOSTNAME addresses, then include
the file in george.cast.
