/* Particle based object tracker using edge geometry models

The ObjectTracker is a component that tracks objects within a camera
image by using a geometrical model, given by the working memory. (VisualObject)
It is able to run in real time and to track several objects within one image.

Therefore a particle filtering system is implemented. To rise the accuracy,
please increase the number of particles and recursions. This of course reduces
the speed of the system.


Installation prerequieries:
---------------------------

MODERN GRAPHICS CARD
	best: NVIDIA
	not working on ATI and old graphics cards because of poor implementation of the
	drivers, especially regarding glsl (opengl shading language)

SDL:
	libsdl1.2-dev

OpenCV:
	libcv-dev
	libcvaux-dev
	libhighgui-dev

OpenGL implementation like:
	freeglut
	mesa
	...
		
	
// if anything missing please inform me

Hints:
------



Key settings:
-------------
Works only if focus is on the ObjectTracker-Window of the tracker

Esc:	quit tracker
e:		draw edge map of camera image (toggle)
l:		lock tracker at current position
m:		show matching pixels (red=match, blue=edge tolerance failed, black=no edge)
p:		show particles
s:		show statistics
t:		grab texture from image
z:		set tracker to initial position
1:		set size of pixel matching kernel to 1
2:		set size of pixel matching kernel to 2
3:		set size of pixel matching kernel to 3
