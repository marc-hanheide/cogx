# Intrinsic parameters for pinhole camera model.
# The pinhole camera model is as follows:
# m = A*(R*M + t)
#
# M .. 3x1 world point [mm]
# A .. 3x3 camera intrinsic matrix
#          |f_x  0  c_x|
#      A = | 0  f_y c_y|
#          | 0   0   1 |
#      c_x, c_y .. principal point [pix]
#      f_x, f_y .. focal length in [pix]
#                  f_x = f/s_x, f_y = f/s_y
#                  with f the focal length in [mm] and s_x, s_y the pixel
#                  sizes in [mm/pix]
# R,t .. 3x3 rotation matrix and 3x1 translation vector [mm]
#      pose of camera w.r.t. world (= extrinsic parameters)
# m .. 3x1 image point in homogenous co-ordinates
#      image point in cartesian pixel co-ordinates is given as
#      (x, y) = (m_x/m_z, m_y/m_z)
# Note that only the ratios focal length to pixel size can be determined.
# Given a (known) nominal focal length f (e.g. from camera data sheet) we
# can calculate:
# s_x = f/f_x .. horizontal pixel size [mm/pix]
# s_y = f/f_y .. vertical pixel size [mm/pix]
# r = s_x/s_y .. pixel aspect ratio
#
# Distortion is modelled as follows:
# x_d = x + x*(k1*r^2 + k2*r^4) + 2*p1*x*y + p2*(r^2 + 2*x^2)
# y_d = y + y*(k1*r^2 + k2*r^4) + 2*p1*x*y + p2*(r^2 + 2*y^2)
#
# where (x, y) are ideal, distortion-free image physical co-ordinates,
# (x_d, y_d) are distorted image physical co-ordinates and r^2 = x^2 + y^2
#
# w, h .. image width and height
