CogX RGB-D Dataset Instructions

The aim of this system is to collect a large RGB-D dataset (alongside with
laser scans and odometry) from all CogX sites. The end result will be publicly available
under as a dataset.


COMPILATION
========================

1. Run ./compile.sh.(compiles the system the usual
way i.e. mkdir BUILD, cmake .. , make install. The
default CMake options should be sufficient.)

2. that's it!

RUNNING
=====================

1. Now launch castctrl and use the save_data.cast file.
Some remarks:
	-  --save-to-file option: This makes the servers save the sensory data.
	-  --save-directory option: This specifies the place for saving.
	-  --display-rgb in KinectPCServer to see the RGB image (note: for this the opencv should be build with gtk or qt)

If you change nothing these are set as data/rgbd, data/laser and data/odom.

2. The script ./packdata tar.gz the data directory with a new name called: data.tar.gz
3. The script ./cleandata removes the files under data/rgbd, data/laser and data/odom AND data.tar.gz


SENDING THE FILES
=================

After you've collected the data, call the script ./packdata
this will produce a data.tar.gz file which should be then sent.

TROUBLESHOOTHING
=====================

Will be updated as problems occur.
