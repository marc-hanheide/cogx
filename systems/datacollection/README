
== CogX Dataset Manual ==

The aim of the datacollection system is to collect a large RGB-D dataset (alongside with
laser scans and odometry) from all CogX sites. 
The end result will be publicly available under as a dataset.

=== COMPILATION ===

Check out the system with this command.

svn co https://codex.cs.bham.ac.uk/svn/nah/cogx/code/systems/datacollection

1. Run ./compile.sh (compiles the system the usual
way i.e. mkdir BUILD, cmake .. , make install. The
default CMake options should be sufficient.)

2. that's it!


=== RUNNING ===



Note: Make sure you have enough free space in your hard drive. This will take between 15-25 GB of space. (or more depending how much data you acquire)

1. Launch Cast Control (type: ./castcontrol.py) and use the save_data.cast file at the ROOT of the directory.

Some remarks:
        -  --save-to-file option: This makes the servers save the sensory data.
        -  --save-directory option: This specifies the place for saving.
        -  --display-rgb in KinectPCServer to see the RGB image (note: for this the opencv should be build with gtk or qt)
        -  --max-joyw and --max-joyv limits the joystick max speed for the robot so that consecutive images are not too far apart from each other.

If you change nothing the data is saved to data/rgbd, data/laser and data/odom.

2. There are two more scripts
        -  ./packdata compresses the data directory to a new file called: data.tar.gz
        -  ./cleandata removes the files under data/rgbd, data/laser and data/odom AND data.tar.gz

Note: The system tilts the PTZ downwards to see table-tops and so on. Change this in a different run if some objects placed higher (such as light switches)
---------------
== INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING DATA ==
Now, since you have the system up and running, drive the robot around carefully in your lab (or even home if you can!) using the joystick.
The more rooms you visit and the more variation the better.

Furthermore we need to make sure certain class objects are included in certain scenes'''.
Please make sure the below is included in the view during a run and the scenes are close to natural.
Also check for scenes where the most of the room is visible in a large scale scene (for ex. while entering a room driving)
== Office objects ==

Table-top:
 * cups
 * computer mouse, keyboard, monitor
 * book

Wall - Door :
 * power outlet (near the floor)
 * light switch
 * painting/picture
 * door handles 
 * White board / White board markers

Floor:
 * trashcan
 * chair
 * sofa
 * shoes

Shelves:
 * book
 * ...

== Kitchen objects ==

Kitchen counter-top:
 * Kitchen sink area
 * cups/mug/plates
 * Coffee machine/kettle

Table-top:
 * Plates with cutlery


== INSTRUCTIONS FOR PACKING AND SENDING DATA ==

1. Inspect the images you've collected under the data/rgbd folder to make sure the objects
are clearly visible and scenes are whole. Basically check against something funny happening.

2. Run ./packdata.sh''', this creates a data.tar.gz file.

3. Upload the data.tar.gz''' file through a webpage which will be announced soon.

=== Troubleshooting ===

'''Problem''': I cannot connect to PTZ/Robot/Laser!

'''Solution''': 
Check the player config file, probably a port option is wrong for devices. e.g. ptx has /dev/ttyUSB1 but in reality it should be ttyUSB0. Plug and unplug to see which device has which port.
