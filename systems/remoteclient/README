== Installation ==

Client machine:
{{{
svn co https://codex.cs.bham.ac.uk/svn/nah/cogx/code/systems/remoteclient
cd remoteclient/bin
make
}}}


=== First run ===

Client machine:
{{{
cd remoteclient
./ccagent --rsync --build
}}}

Development machine:
{{{
cd systems/mysystem
./castcontrol
}}}

Select a .hconf file with the IP of the client machine:
{{{
# example .hconf
HOST  myhost   192.168.47.23
}}}

Press the button "Discover agents". The machine should be listed in the process tree.

In the "Build" tab select "Build: " = "Remote" and press "Synchronize". This
operation may take a while. CAST Control is not responsive while synchronizing.

Select "Build.Make Install" from the menu.


=== Configure the remote host build process ===

Client machine:
{{{
cd remoteclient/BUILD
ccmake ..
}}}

or

{{{
cd remoteclient
./castcontrol
}}}

Select "Build.Configure with CMake" from the menu.

Some parts of the build may have to be configured manually (like the V4R library).

The scripts cmake-freeze and cmake-apply may be useful in the process.
