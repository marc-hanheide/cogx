Building the system
===================

If the file BUILD/CMakeCache.txt doesn't exist, you can create one with:

   bash sysconfig/prepare_build.sh

This will create the BUILD directory and run cmake with the initial cache file
sysconfig/cmakecache/george-y3.txt.

Change into BUILD and run make or start the build from CAST Control. If you
encounter problems with the libraries levmar or homest, you may have to change
F2C_LIB from 'f2c' to 'f2c.a' in ccmake.

If you want to restore the set of components that are built in the George
system, use the following command:

   tools/scripts/cmake-apply BUILD sysconfig/cmakecache/george-y3.txt

To save the current set of components:

   tools/scripts/cmake-freeze > my-components.txt


Mac users
---------

The command 'readlink -f' doesn't work on Mac and there are some problems
between sed and the shell. Do the following:

  mkdir BUILD
  cd BUILD
  ccmake -C ../sysconfig/cmakecache/george-y3.txt  ..


Changing externals
==================

The externals can be changed with the script applyexternals.sh in sysconfig:

   cd sysconfig
   bash  applyexternals.sh  george-y3-trunk.externals
   svn up ..

if the .externals file is not provided, the default file george-y3.externals
will be used.


The VisualLearner component
===========================

If you don't have the Matlab Compiler you have to download the prebuilt
component from  http://cogx.eu/data/cogx/prebuilt/ and install the files into

 subarchitectures/vision.sa/prebuilt/VisualLearner/glnx86

You can also use the George Year 2 DVD ISO to run the VisualLearner component
inside the virtual machine. See
