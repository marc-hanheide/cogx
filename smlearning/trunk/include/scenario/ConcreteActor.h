*
*	The ConcreteActor class sets shape, rotation and position of an object within a given scene.
*	This means that the class represents the concrete description of an actor.
*	In order to model a concrete actor one has to derive a class from ConcreteActor and define
*	the getShape function in that derived one.
*
*	The ConcreteActor class is used as an object for the ActorObject class.
