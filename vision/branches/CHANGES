design 

removed read/write distinction, get code separate though
removed normal/privved distinction in lew of a better solution

c++

map input to configure method is now const
all cdl consts have had _s removed
getProcessIdentifier -> getComponentID
all process -> component
removed all UI parts for now
removed CASTProcessingComponent::subarchitectureID -> getSubarchitectureID
removed makeAdress (Henrik's typo) -> should have built in constructors in Ice classes
renamed CASTProcessingComponent -> SubarchitectureComponent
exceptions now defined in via slice, no header files
WorkingMemoryWriterProcess -> WorkingMemoryWriterComponent
taken never-used functionality out of CASTData. let me know if you're missing anything
getWorkingMemoryEntry deprecated - use alternatives for simpler accessSu
newCOmponent now should return cast::interfaces::CASTComponentPtr 
no async writes to wm
BALTTime -> CASTTime


java

configure now takes a map<string,string>

build system, list of subdirs, and each subdir contains a file listing
slice files, source, libraries


vision

see "Changes_Nick_Vision.txt" to see the changes from "cast-0.2.0rc2.tar.gz" in the cogx-request email (15.04.2009) from Nick Hawes
in subarchitectures/vision.sa/src/slice/VisionData.ice added new struct ObjectGeometry, Face and Vertex and related sequences (lists)

 


todo
use ice mutexes in SubarchitectureWorkingMemory - overwrite has deadlock on exception

check logic of lockEntryHelper. what if lock fails but permissions match
check logic of stored version numbers -- do we rely on ids being different? what's the trade-off
async writes etc are missing 
flushes before locking?
efficiency of overwrites due to locking. migrate to wm?

all idl-defined constants are now in CamelCase
