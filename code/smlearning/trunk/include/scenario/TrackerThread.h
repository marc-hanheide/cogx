/** \brief The thread class permitting to run the blort tracker in a thread.
*
* The blort tracker is a standalone program. In order to use it in parallel for further applications like being the eye
* for an real world acting robot, it is implemented as a thread.
* Since intentionally the position of the tracked object is needed it is somehow apparent that the thread is able to return the 
* object position (getPose). 
* The thread runs in principle the standalone.cpp, where the initialization is done in the cto TrackerThread and the loop is 
* executed in the OnTask function.
*
* \param _object_pose contains the pose of the object
* \param _new_position is true if there was a new object position stored
* \param _quit is true if the program was ended
* \param _img captured camera image
* \param _m_tracker is tracking the object and containing all central information
* \param _m_window is the ouput OpenGL Window
* \param _id_2 is the object identification number
* \param _movement is the current state of the object movement (fast / slow / still )
* \param _quality is the current quality of object visibilty ( ok / occluded / lost / locked )
* \param _confidence is the current confidence of the model ( good / fair / bad )
* \param m_timer, m_evData thread specific variables
*
