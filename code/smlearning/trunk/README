These are instructions to install SMLearning on a Ubuntu machine.
Please let us know if you want a version for Windows.

Install following packages (Ubuntu 8.10 and higher):
libnetcdf-dev
qt4-qmake
libqt4-core
libqt4-dev
libqwt5-qt4-dev

Download boost (http://www.boost.org) and install it (e.g. v1.39):
$ cd <path of boost sources>
$ sh tools/jam/src/build.sh
$ sudo tools/jam/src/bin.linuxx86/bjam --prefix=/usr/local --libdir=/usr/local/lib install

In Ubuntu 9.04 you can install the boost package v1.37:
libboost1.37-dev

In Ubuntu 9.10 you can install libboost1.40-dev or libboost-dev

Probably you will also have to install libboost-date-time1.xx-dev,
libboost-iostreams1.xx-dev and libboost-filesystem1.xx-dev
for Ubuntu 9.04 or higher

Check out the library rnnlib from a git repository. First go
to a desired directory and type:

$ git clone git://github.com/sergioroa/RNNLIB.git

Then, install the library:

$ cd RNNLIB
$ CXXFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include/boost-1_39/ ./configure

Or in Ubuntu 9.04, simply:
$ ./configure

$ make
$ sudo make install

Procedures to install SMLearning:

Download and install Golem and KNI libraries:
$ svn co https://codex.cs.bham.ac.uk/svn/msk/development/KNI
$ svn co https://codex.cs.bham.ac.uk/svn/msk/development/Golem

using the traditional cmake installation procedure (please check README files).

Then, go to the SMLearning directory (either trunk or some other version)
and type these commands:

$ cd cmake
$ mkdir BUILD
$ cd BUILD
$ ccmake ..

You will possibly have to put the right path to boost_filesystem and boost_regex.

For instance, when using Boost v1.39:

Boost_FILESYSTEM_LIBRARY    /usr/local/lib/libboost_filesystem-gcc43-mt-1_39.so     
Boost_INCLUDE_DIR           /usr/local/include/boost-1_39
Boost_LIBRARY_DIRS          /usr/local/lib
Boost_REGEX_LIBRARY         /usr/local/lib/libboost_regex-gcc43-mt-1_39.so

Finally, compile the SMLearning sources:

$ make
$ sudo make install

In order to compile the documentation, just type in the root directory of the project:

$ doxygen doc/Doxyfile

Good luck! ;)
