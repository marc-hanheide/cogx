/** @file ScenarioIce.h
 * 
 * Learning scenario where the arm moves along a straight line
 * using reactive trajectory planner and collision detection
 * simulating a pushing action on a polyflap
 * 
 * Program can be run in two modes:
 * - the first uses real Katana arm
 * - the second runs the arm simulators
 *
 * offline and active modes of learning are available
 * Ice Interface
