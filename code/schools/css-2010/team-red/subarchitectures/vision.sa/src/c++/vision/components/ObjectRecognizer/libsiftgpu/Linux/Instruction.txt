
The list of required libraries is 

libCg.so	libCgGL.so	libGLEW.a	libglut.so
libIL.so -> libIL.so.1 		libIL.so.1	libCudart.so

Those libraris may also be dependent on other libraries, and you may need to download them yourself. You also need to handle the compatibility of those libraies yourself. 

Get those libraries either in the system default path or ./bin here before compiling. 

The output binaries are 
./bin/libsiftgpu.a	./bin/TestWinGlut	./bin/SimpleSIFT 	./bin/speed


If you want to run the stuff with any .so files in ./bin, don't forget to add . to LD_LIBRARY_PATH by calling:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:.


If some of your header files (e.g. GL/gl.h )are not in the default path (e.g. /usr/include ), you'll need to add extra flags to CFLAGS in the makefile. Say, your opengl header are in /myheaders/GL. You'll need to add -isystem/myheader to CFLAGS.
