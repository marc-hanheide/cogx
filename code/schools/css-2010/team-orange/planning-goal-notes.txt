PLANNER NOTES

* robot is in ?X: move ?robot ?to ?from

(is-in robot place_id2)

* all places ?X have been visited: move, with (update (visited ?to) true)
 
(forall (?p place) (visited ?p))

* place location for one human is known: 

(exists (?h person) (?p place) (?r robot) (is-in ?h ?p) (kval ?r ?p))

* room name for one human is known 

(exists (?h person) (?p place) (?r robot) (is-in ?h ?p) (kval ?r (name ?p)))

* place locations for all humans are known 

(exists (?r robot) (forall (?h human) (?p place) (is-in ?h ?p) (kval ?r ?p)))

* room names for all humans are known 

(exists (?r robot) (forall (?h human) (?p place) (is-in ?h ?p) (kval ?r (name ?p))))

* place locations for all objects are known 

(exists (?r robot) (forall (?o object) (?p place) (kval ?r (is-in ?o ?p)) (visited ?p)))

// can't just require that the robot knows the place because that's by default

* room names for place locations for all objects are known: whenever an object is found, ensure you know the place name, do this buy asking, which means that we need to know where there is a human 


(exists (?r robot) (forall (?o object) (?p place) (kval ?r (is-in ?o ?p)) (visited ?p) (kval ?r (name ?p))))
