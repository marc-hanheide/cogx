PLANNER NOTES

[ orange-0.domain.map ] testable in standalone with [ move1.problem.mapl ] 

* move to place p4 

(:goal (= (is-in dora) p4))

* visit all places 

(:goal (forall (?p - place) (= (visited ?p) true) ))

* look for objects in all places 

(:goal (forall (?p - place) (= (searched ?p) true) ))






* place location for one human is known: 

(exists (?h person) (?p place) (?r robot) (is-in ?h ?p) (kval ?r ?p))

* room name for one human is known 

(exists (?h person) (?p place) (?r robot) (is-in ?h ?p) (kval ?r (name ?p)))

* place locations for all humans are known 

(exists (?r robot) (forall (?h human) (?p place) (is-in ?h ?p) (kval ?r ?p)))

* room names for all humans are known 

(exists (?r robot) (forall (?h human) (?p place) (is-in ?h ?p) (kval ?r (name ?p))))

* place locations for all objects are known 

(exists (?r robot) (forall (?o object) (?p place) (kval ?r (is-in ?o ?p)) (visited ?p)))

// can't just require that the robot knows the place because that's by default

* room names for place locations for all objects are known: whenever an object is found, ensure you know the place name, do this buy asking, which means that we need to know where there is a human 

(exists (?r robot) (forall (?o object) (?p place) (kval ?r (is-in ?o ?p)) (visited ?p) (kval ?r (name ?p))))
