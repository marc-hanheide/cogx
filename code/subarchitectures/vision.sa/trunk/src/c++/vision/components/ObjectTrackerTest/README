/* Test for the object tracker component
*
*  @author: Thomas MÃ¶rwald, April 2009
*
*  This component is an example on how to control the
*  object tracker by loading a model from ply-file
*  to the working memory and calling several tracking commands.

Testing the tracker
-------------------

The tracker can be tasted by using the "subarchitectures/vision.sa/config/test-tracker/test-tracker.cast".
Do not press any button while the test is running.
Wait until the message [LOG "TrackerDriver": Tracking test successfull] appears.
If tracking fails please contact me: moerwald@acin.tuwien.ac.at
