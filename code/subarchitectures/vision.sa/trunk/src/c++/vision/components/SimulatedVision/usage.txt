Add SimulatedVision component to cast file:

   SUBARCHITECTURE visualization.sa 
   CPP WM SubarchitectureWorkingMemory
   CPP TM AlwaysPositiveTaskManager

   CPP MG display.srv DisplayServer --log true --debug true

   SUBARCHITECTURE vision.sa
   CPP WM SubarchitectureWorkingMemory
   CPP TM AlwaysPositiveTaskManager

   CPP MG sim.vision SimulatedVision --displayserver "display.srv" --datadir "/path/to/dir"
      # --log true --debug true

Create (empty) files for the objects and scenes that you will be using.
Object files have an extension '.tobj'. Scene files have an extension '.tscn'. 
The files are formatted as INI files.

Start a CAST system. The component will read the list of objects and scenes
from the data directory.

You should see a view named "Vision.Simulator" in the Display Server.  In the 
top form you can edit the attributes of an object.  The first drop-list selects 
the object to be edited. The others are used to set its attributes.

Select a value of the property from the drop-down list and set its probability 
in the edit box (0.0 - 1.0; data validation is missing, so be careful).

When ready, press "Apply" to save the attributes to the component's
internal memory or "Apply&Save" to also save the data to the disk.


Set the content of the scene in the bottom form.

When ready, press "Create Scene" to save scene to the component's internal 
memory or "Create&Save Scene" to also save the data to the disk. Both buttons 
will also write into the working memory. Currently, the old contents of WM is 
deleted and new objects are created; overwriteWorkingMemory is not used.

The button "Erase Scene" removes the objects from WM.


Below the second form the current contents of WM is displayed after a "Create 
Scene" operation.


WORKAROUND: Currently it is not possible to add new attribute values to the 
objects. To add more attributes, create a new object (eg 'xdummy.tobj') and set 
missing attribute values:

   [color]
   @near_green=0.21
   @near_red=0.31

   [shape]
   @sharp=0.22

   [label]
   @tv_box=0.63

The '@' from at the beginning is required and will be removed. The values will 
be converted to lower case.
