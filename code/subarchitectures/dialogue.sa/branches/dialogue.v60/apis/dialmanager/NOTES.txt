Libraries for dialogue management
Current version: 0.1
Main developer: Pierre Lison (plison@dfki.de)


==== LATEST UPDATES ===


Version 0.1:
------------

1) Smooth handling of various kinds of dialogue actions and  
observations (shallow inputs and outputs, events, intentions);

2) Events and intentions can be expressed with arbitrarily complex  
formulae (a dedicated parser is available to convert a string  
representation into a slice-based logical content);

3) Expected observations can be associated with probability ranges  
(for instance, you can specify that the observation of a particular  
utterance will only "fire" if its probability value lies between 0.2  
and 0.7);

4) Unrecognised intentions can be explicitly represented (using a the  
character ? to denote the unknown value);

5) And finally, we even have a basic support for underspecified  
observations (using a simple wildcard * on possible formulae).
