# This file contains some important categories used by modifiers like
# adjectives, adverbs and prepositions 

# 1) the complex-syntactic categories used in their type-changing rules
# 2) the semantic dependency relations used for modifiers
# 3) syn & sem categories for modifier arguments (like the np arg of prepositions)
# 4) a generic dictionary-entry macro for modifier-modifiers.


####################################
# SYNTACTIC COMPLEX-CAT CATEGORIES #
####################################

# These correspond to the various cc-cat values given to modifiers
# such as prepositions, adverbs, adjectives etc.
#
# The mod argument is the modifier-class corrisponding to the modifier-type of the
# modifier. This is restricts the type of sentences which can be modified.
# I have used MCLASS:mod vs. MCLASS=mod b/c we only want the sentence(verb) to 
# have a class which unifies with the modifier. We don't want to change its value. 
#
# The syn argument here corresponds to any arguments that the modifier 
# may have 'following it', e.g. the np arg of a preposition.
# The ordering here is crucial for incremental parsing:
#	For pre-modifiers, the modifier args will come first then the modifee
#   For post-modifiers, the modifee comes and then then the mod args

## RULES ##

  # The following rules convert the 'base-generated' atomic cat versions of pps and turns them
  # into their complex-cat form (i.e. the form that actually attach to and modify nouns and sentences)
  # Remember, this combinatorial capacity is specified in the actual dictionary entry of the word
  # by assigning it to a particular cc-class
 
  # see modifiers.ccg for the syntactic ( post-n(), pre-s(), etc ) and semantic ( MODIFIER() ) categories
  # used in these rules  
	    
  # !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  # IMPORTANT: If either the dependency relation name (e.g. <Modifier> , <Location> ) or the
  #            modifier section of the ontological hierarchy is changed, you will have to add
  #            a new 'instance' of these rules for each.
  # !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

  ## Nominal Modifiying Rules ##
 
  # All preps which can modify nouns, post-modify them ( 'the ball on the table', not 'the on the table ball')
  #
 
      rule { typechange: pp(post-n)$1        =>     post-n(, $1)   :  ENTITY( MODIFIER() ) ; }

  # One 'instance' of the rule for each of the modifier classes (from ontology)
  #


  ## Sentential Modifying Rules ##
  #
  # For each of the many sentential/clausal possibilities for prepositions, their is a corresponding rule.

  #    rule { typechange: pp(pre-s)$1           =>   pre-s2($1)         :  EVENT( MODIFIER() ) ; }

  ### Other Rules ###
  
  # These rules handle 
  # 1) nested locationals such as 'It is in the room on the table'
  #    c.f.   get me the ball on the table
  #    Note that this does not give the underlying semantics  (ball on table, table in room) but must be
  #    built grammar externally. This was due to problems in incrementally building 
  #   'inside out' semantic structures like this. 
  #
  # 2) sequences of dynamics: go into the hall, down the corrider ....
  # 


 #  rule { typechange: pp<52>[F x-dynamic CC-TYPE:CC-TYPE COM=no]   =>    pp<53>[R x-dynamic CC-TYPE:CC-TYPE COM=yes] /^   pp<54>[N x-dynamic CC-TYPE:CC-TYPE]  
 #                                                                 : R:m-dynamic( list <First>(F:m-dynamic) ^ <Next>(N:m-dynamic) ) ; }

 #  rule { typechange: pp<52>[F x-location CC-TYPE:CC-TYPE COM=no]   =>   pp<53>[R x-location CC-TYPE:CC-TYPE COM=yes] /^  pp<54>[N x-location CC-TYPE:CC-TYPE]

# standard verbs, the copular and mood rules

#################################
# VERB ARGUMENTS: SLOTS & ROLES # 
#################################

# These are the syntactic slots and corresponding semantic roles
# used for verbal arguments(compliments)

# Semantic Role cats are, like all semantic cats, in CAPS.

# The general format for syn-cat names is type_slot# (args) for the bare compliment itself.
# For the comp plus its slash, +type_slot# (args)

# The slots are numbered based on their left to right position after the verb itself, so
#	    	_SUBJ_	 VERB		_1_			_2_				_3_
                        
# 1)		  I      slept  
# 2)		  I      hit		the ball
# 3)		  I      gave		him			the ball
# 4)		  I		 gave		it			to  him
# 5)		  I		 picked		it			up
# 6)		  I		 put		it			on the table
# 7)          I		 want								    to run
# 8)	      I	     want		him							to run
		 
# As you can see, the slot position is independent of the category (or kind) of the compliment.
# So in 3, 4, 5, 6 we have a NP, an OBLIQUE, a PARTICLE and a PP all in slot 3. Thus,
# the variable name for a given syntactic argument is a combination of category and slot position:
# Verb(vp) & Sentence comps are an exception, they are always in slot 3.. this was just a pragmatic
# decision to avoid doubling all of the cats.

  # !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  # IMPORTANT:  
  #         Although there are no semantic constraints for entites (animacy, etc)
  #         some of these verb-roles are restricting for modifiers (where-to and location, e.g.)
  #         Changes to the modifier section of ontological hierarchy will need be reflected here

# MOOD RULES #
##############

  # The mood of a clause is projected as early as possible. i.e. we don't wait for the verb.
  # Instead, the first 'core' element of the clause does this
  #   Indicative: a free standing, clause initial NP
  #   Imperative: a base form verb wanting a subject (see below for dropped subjects)
  #   Interrogative: auxillaries in Y/N & Wh-words in Wh cases (see wh-words.ccg , verb-finite.ccg and copular section below for more)  
 
  rule {no typeraise;   # b/c indicative rule handles the building of standard indicative clauses, no need for type-raise
                        # this removes the unncessary readings
	no sub;}        # THIS ADDED TO KILL STUPID COLLAPSED ARG READINGS 'put this on the table' with this & table co-indexed.


  # The 'floating' subject np in the early stages of the (incremental) parsing of indicatives and interrogatives
  # is integrated into the utterance semantics by assigning it to the dependency slot <Subject>
  # Althoug it may seem it, this is not entirely a hack.
  # At these early stages, this np may not have a Thematic (Ideational) role (i.e actor, patient, etc) assigned to it by
  # its verb, but it has a very important interpersonal role. It is the thing which is argued with
 
  # It's big.                             
  # No, it's small, isn't it. 
  # It shouldn't be, should it.
  # etc.
  
  # i.e. it plays the role of Subject in the Mood structure of Systemic Functional Linguistics
  
  def SUBJECT(args)         { <Subject>(S:entity args) }

  # This creates indicative clauses out of any old NP, either as the subject (in Systemic Functional Grammar sense) or as a Fronted-object
  # as in 'this one I dont like'

  #  rule { typechange: subj() $1                           =>  from-s(s-ind ) /  ( s(VFORM:fin-clause s-minor) +subj() )  $1                             : EVENT( IND() SUBJECT() )             ; }

  # this rule creates a dependent, moodless clause with MOOD=s-dependent (the form mimics that of ind above)

 # These rules turn verbs wanting subjects into 1) imperatives and 
 #                                               2) verbs with contextually 'alighted' (i.e. dropped) subjects
 # Despite standard claims that English is not a pro-drop language, it is still a widely attested phenomena

  ##################################
    
  # First entry handles coordinated vps, i.e. subject controlled vp chains.
  # Every syn feature except for modifier class must be identical. If this weren't allowed to differ, 
  # couldnt handle I walked in and picked it up, cuz walk and pick have dif m-classes. 
  
  # Note: A nice consistent handling of these clausal chains seem to require the imp-rules above
  #       By converting s[base]\!np into imps, this entry allows the chaining of multiple vps
  #       to be 'converted' into an imp only once, thus having a single mood scoping over the
  #       whole chain. With base-level (lexical) s/args : E( <Mood>imp ... args), this wouldn't be possible
  
  # Question: what should the m-class of the result be?
  
  # Second entry handles general sentence coordination. The conjuncts must be mooded-clauses, 
  # the result is of general s-major mood and 'fin' verb form (if you don't give it a verb form
  # then some rules will grap a hold of it and make silly readings (e.g. see rules around imperatives)
  #   NOTE: May 15 restricted these to being ind or int, not dropped subject ind (s-ind-ell) or imp.
  #         This is because we want those to be handled using the vp-chains. This reduces number of parses
  #         and looks more sexy, like Givon's(1995)   S[subj vp vp vp vp vp ...] treatment

#   Role-Defined Constituents  ( I picked up 'WHAT you wanted', I don't know 'WHO he is', etc)
#   Relative Clauses (the ball THAT you picked up)   

# For the sake of incremental parsing and early projection, all of these are treated 
# as the semantic and syntactic head of their respective constituents. 

######## WH-WORDS ############

# There are two entries for most of the question words, one for copulars, 'Who am I' 
# and one for other verbs which must use an auxillary, 'What did you see'

# They assign mood (both syntactic and semantic), select for the clauses Subject, 
# and properly distribute the features dictated by the specifics of the question word

# This file contains most dictionary entries. 
# Specifically, the 'open class words' 
#        nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, discourse-markers, mod-modifiers

# The entries have been sorted first by 'Part of Speech' then by ontological sort (person, thing, etc)

# All entries are entered using one of the 'dictionary-entry' macros (defs) listed in the various .ccg files
# in the grammar proper. 

# Althoug, of course, you must check the apporpriate file for specifics,
# the standard convention for these dictionary-entry macros is 
#
#     macro-name( various forms, ontological sort (i.e. class), other arguments (including feature-macros, family listing) )
#
# For alternate variations (i.e. different entries with the same predicate (e.g. forward, forwards) )
# for each additional form, you must add a separate entry using the alternate-form macro.
#
#     _macro-name(predicate, various forms, ontological sort (i.e. class), other arguments (including feature-macros, family listing) ) 
#
# This is Identical to the standard macro, except, it is prefaced with an underscore _, and the first element is the predicate, then
# the alternate variation in all of its forms
# 
#  e.g. Here are the entries for the adverbs 'slow' & alternate 'slowly' 
#           adverb(slowly, manner, adv-all,) 
#          _adverb(slowly, slow, manner, adv-all,)

# NOTE:
# There is currently, unlike in older Moloko, a way of handling Multi-word expressions.

# NOTE: In some of the cases below, the 'expected' number of parses will be incorrect

testbed {

  # And now on to the show....

  ####################################
  # The 3 moods & INCREMENTAL PARSES #
  ####################################

  # Indicative #

  # Indicative mood is no longer attributed to an utterance by its verb.
  # Instead, it is handled by type-changing rule which, essentially, adds
  # some semantics to your standard np type-raising rule.
  # Any 'floating' np can become the <Subject> of an indicative clause waiting for its verb+args (vp)

  # Motivation: 1) early projection. When we 'see' an NP in first position in the clause we know it is
  # either the 'Subject' of indicative, or it is a fronted object, or pre-np. See end of this for 
  # these cases. Thus, there is no reason to 'wait' for the verb to explicitly represent this info
  #             2) semantic integration. By placing the subject in a semantic slot, we now can avoid
  # multiple un-integrated semantic fragments in simple sentences. Specifically 'I really' now recieves
  # an integrated reading, which 'knows' it is part of a yet unspecified event.
  #

  # An example 

  the: 6 ;                                            # free-np, subj-np of ind-clause, fronted-np of ind-clause, etc      x 2 for 2 readings of the
  the pizza: 3 ;                                      # lose the plural readings of the
  the pizza on: 3;                                    # "
  the pizza on the: 6;                                # 2 readings of the
  the pizza on the big: 6;                            # "
  the pizza on the big red: 6;                        # "
  the pizza on the big red table: 3;                  # lose the plural reading of the
  the pizza on the big red table makes : 4;           # 4 readings of make ( make dinner, make me run, make me hungry (this one has 2 readings see verbs.ccg) ) 
  the pizza on the big red table makes me : 3;        # "
  the pizza on the big red table makes me hungry: 1;  # 
  
  
  # Interrogatives #
  
  # Wh-questions are controlled by their Wh-word, i.e. the first word projects the structure of the clause.
  # Moreover, to allow fully integrated incrental parsing, they 'select for' (i.e. have syn and/or sem slots for)
  # the auxillary (which then fills in tense, aspect, verbal-agreemnt, polarity, etc), the 'Subject' and then
  # the 'verb missing an arg' 
	
  # Note: Currently, only arguments, not modifiers, can be wh questioned. We can't handle 'extracted optional elements'
  #       Of course, you can question pp args, like 'who did you walk with', b/c once they 'attach' to the verb, their
  #       argument is treated as any old missing arg.
  #       As a hack to handle where questions for motion verbs, I added to each a verbal family with an explicit <Dynamic>
  #       argument. So you can now ask  Where are you going?  BUT NOT where are you playing?
  		  
  # An example (note increase of readings in 4 -> 5)
    
  what: 4;                              # aux-obj, aux-sent-comp, subj, copular-obj
  what did: 4;                          # aux-obj, aux-sent-comp, subj (with did as aux), subj (with did as proverb, e.g. What did it )
  what did GJ: 2;                       # aux-obj, aux-sent-comp
  what did GJ see: 1;                   # aux-obj (transitive reading of see)  
  what did GJ see under: 2;                # aux-obj (transitive reading of see), prep-arg (intranstive reading of see)  
  what did GJ see under the: 2;         # aux-obj (transitive reading of see) with 2 readings of the
  what did GJ see under the table: 1;   # aux-obj (transitive reading of see)

  # Y-N Questions

  # Here, the aux, as first element, controls the mood.
  # Much like Wh-words, it selects for subject & then vp.
  
  are: 32;            # yeah... it's the be-verb and this english, whaddya expect
  are you: 22;        # still loads of possibilities
  are you coming: 4;  # sg/pl for you, with/out dynamic (see above)
 
  # Imperatives (and alighted Subjects) 

  # as the verb is the first element in an imperative clause, it controls the clause.
  # this should be done as it was in moloko, i.e. with a separate verbal category and hence lexical family for each verb.
  # HOWEVER, b-c it would lead to sheer messiness under Dot-CCG, I've added type-changing rules for this...sigh....
    
  # Also, by building verbs like this s\np /args instead of s /args \np  we will necessarily get all of the 'missing subject'
  # readings. I did, however, shut off the subject slot (via !), so we don't see them in other places.
  # A simple way to prune these silly readings is to check the mood. If it is un-specified, prune it. All readings that we 
  # want will have a mood specified somehow (via rule, or via lexical items)
  # For this reason, I added an 'alighted subject' reading as well. (see verbs.ccg for arguments for this.. can still of course remove)
	
  # NOTE: what should we 'call' the alighted subj & imperative actor (currently have em as context, see context entities below)
  #       what about the tense of imperatives? obviously its a silly question, and answering it gets into silly philosophical discussions.
  #       I left it out, is that ok?	
	
  go: 4;                        # imp-parse, 3 moodless parses (base, pl, 2nd-singular, see above)
  go over: 30;                  # ummmmm... as it stands, with so many independent dep reln names being used for modifers (location, dynamic, etc) 
                                # mod-modifiers like over lead to an explosin in readings 
  go over to: 5;                # lose all but <dynamic>, get 1 imp and 4 moodless...

  ## Blocking Modifiers ##

  ## Each verb has the right to choose its own 'potential modifiers', i.e., semantically restrict what kinds 
  ## of things it can take. See the m-class in types-features.ccg for list of restriction classes.
  
  # Although Nouns, nor Modifiers are doing this right now, could in theory be implemented quite naturally.
  
  I am happy to the the table: 0;  # copulars can't take dynamics

  I went to the table: 1;          # motion verbs can
  
  I want it on the table: 1;       # this is a <goal> participant of want, but still blocks dynamic on.
  I walked on the table: 3;           # currently motion verbs like this accept <location> (static) and <dynamic> readings
  								   # Note: 3rd reading is due to hack handling of where questions..... 
		
			   
    ## NOTE: A Suggestion ##
  
  # As it stands, we are using quite a few different dependency relations for 'optional modifiers'
  #   ex. <Dynamic>  <Location>  <Time>  <Property> as well as the more general <Modifer>

  # Instead, I suggest a single dependency relation (call it whatever you want to, <Modifer> is as good as any)
  # which is used for each and every semantic relation. 
  # The nature of the relation is specified by the ontological sort of the relation only.
  #      so <Modifier>(m:color green)  <Modifier>(m:location on ...) <Modifier>(m:where-to onto <Arg> ...)
  # The hierarchical information, i.e. that where-to is a dynamic, that color is a physical-property which is a property
  # will be handled exclusively in the ontological sort hierarchy. Hence, external use will need to look this up
  # instead of merely checking the dep-reln name.
  #
  # In the case of these same 'modifiers' playing sem-roles in arg structure, then we would need either one or more
  # different names (like <Goal> or whatever) to handle these. This has the added benefit of allowing post-processing
  # to know whether a locational was selected for and hence playing a core role, or was merely a 'modifier'
  #     e.x.
  # 'I want it on the table'  should not be interpreted as a want event located on the table, but instead like 'put' with a 
  #  'goal' type locational argument.
  #
   
  # Here are some reasons for why I think the single modifer dep-reln is a good idea:
  
  # 1) Uniformity:
  #       -we are already using the type hierarchy to handle the vast majority of different kinds
  #        of dep-relns, e.g. instrument, accompaniment, comment, etc
  #       -this would allow me to clean up some of the grammar by removing multiple 'checks'
  #	       i.e. if you are a location modifier, then become <Location>, if dynamic.....
  #              else <Modifier>		
  #       -modification of the dependency-relation hierarchy would have much less impact on the grammar
  #        as it stands, if we decide to add 'instrument' as dep-reln (instead of say sub-type of modifier)
  #        this would require going in and building a family. If we unify, just have to add to sort-hierarchy
  #        and then to the new dictionary items.
  #
  # 2) Information Redundancy:
  #       As it stands, we have readings like this <Location>(m:location on ...) & <Time>(m:time before ...) 
  #       And as mentioned above, even in cases like <Dynamic>(m:where-to onto...) the sub-type info provided
  #       here is already available in the sort-hierarchy
  #
  # 3) Parse reduction:
  #       We currently get crap loads of readings for 'pre-modifier modifiers' like 'over on the table' or 'really'
  #       The reason, is that as 'over' doesn't know if it is modifying a dynamic, a location, or whatever, then
  #       it gets a reading for each possibility. Even if we eventually 'restrict' these modifiers to only modify 
  #       the correct kinds, we'll still get one reading for each of these dependency-reln 'ambiguities'.
  #       Compare this to if we had a different 'category' for animates and inanimates, then big would be ambiguous
  #       to these two readings and have to generate both readings
  # 
  # 4) Simplification of the Copular
  #       By returning to a uniform treatment of 'things which modify nouns', I could then revert to the much
  #       cleaner copular which takes adj and pps instead of the complex ugliness we had in older moloko
  #       This would mean much easier uniform handling of questions, among other things.
  #             (note: I actually have this simpler version of copulars implemented, but could change back
  #                    to the more complex version from old moloko)

  # Entities: Context Entities, Determiners and Groups  #
  #######################################################
							   		    	  
  # Context Entities #
  
  # I have modified and extended the old Moloko treatment of context nps. Before, we were
  # handling them in two ways:
  # 1) by attaching a dependency relation containing the entities semantic features
  # with some sort of outside 'Shell' 
  #   e.g.    one      @entity(one <Context> (<num, spec, delim>) )
  # 2) with a ontological type of 'discourse-deictic'
  #   e.g.    this     @discourse-deictic(this <proximity, spec, det, num> )
  #
  # I have unified these two types of contextual entities together with a few others (more below)
  # and given them a simpler and more info-rich representation. First, some issues with these
  # two old treatments
  
  # First, 1) was quite difficult to pull off, in the sense, it required gerry-rigging a lot 
  # of extra categories, and as I wanted to expand the idea of contextual entities, it was a pain
  # As well, when these shell nps were modifed 'big one', the 'semantic head' was the outside entity
  # and hence the modifying information was separate from the lexically specified features.
  # Second, 2) has the problem of loosing the ontological info that it is an entity. Furthermore, if
  # we eventually want more semantically refined types of context nps, then this info wouldn't
  # be visible (see also Context Events below)

  # New represenation:  A context entity is exactly like any other entity except its propisition is 
  # the word context. i.e. all of its 'grounding features' (num, spec, prox, etc) are there, along
  # with any modifiers, the only thing that needs to be contextually found is the 'head', or the info
  # that would be given in the 'nominal class'.
  
  # So....  this (as deictic entity)
  #         @entity(context <Proximity>proximal <Num>sg <Quantification>specific_singular <Delimination> unique)
  # what is nice is that now it has exactly the same semantics as 'determiner' this, except 'head' is filled in by context
  # i.e. compare with
  #			this       np/n
  #         @entity(     <Proximity>proximal <Num>sg <Quantification>specific_singular <Delimination> unique)       
  #         this ball  np
  #         @entity(ball <Proximity>proximal <Num>sg <Quantification>specific_singular <Delimination> unique)
  # and further, this as 'event deictic' only differs in its ontological sort.
  #         @event(context <Proximity>proximal <Num>sg <Quantification>specific_singular <Delimination> unique)
  #
  
  # Besides context being used in deictics, it is also used with
  #   1)'discourse one' 
  #   2) numbers (both cardinal and ordinal) 
  #   3) in some Wh-questions (see below)
  #
  #  NOTE: We could extend this to cover other things like some adjectives ('colors' I want the green, etc)
 
  # GROUPS #
    
  # In addition, I have added the handling of 'subgroups' of specified groups.
  #  e.x. one of the balls,   some of GJ's money,   the first of the three balls.
  # 
  # The basic semantics is:    @entity(group
  #                                    'subset specifying info'									
  #                                    <Set>(info specifying the set)
  #
  # subset specifying info is handled by the 'pre-of' stuff (one, some, first, etc)
  # and the set info, by the 'post-of' stuff.
  # So in the cases, like some, where there is no propositional info attached, then only features 
  # at top level. In other case, like numbers, it is contained in a <Modifier>() at this level.

  # THIS WILL ALL BE REPLACE via discourse-units

  # Though certainly not the most important, or interesting feature of the new grammar
  # I figured I should put it first. When you start looking at parses, you'll no doubt 
  # be wondering 'What is all this crap?'

  # Right.
  # People like to place NPs outside clauses, both before and after. 

  # Reasons? task separation (i.e. separating finding/building description of the referent from predicating it), 
  #          info struc, mark logical relations (comparison, listing, etc) 
  #          various interpersonal functions, discourse segmentation, 'repairing' reference etc.
  #
  # Of course all of these tasks are 'extra sentential' and mostly interactive (e.g. only add a 2nd description if
  # they don't seem to get it after the first) but until we handle em in dialogue model, can have it here.
  # clearly will involve some 'post processing' as they do not sub-categorize for these functions, nor does it 
  # make any co-indexing proposals, i.e., treated as separate, i.e. as 'discourse anaphor'(ugh)
    
  # In any case, if you want to shut them off, go to discourse.ccg and comment out the lines.
  
  # there is often some sort of intonational break between clause and np, but not always, and
  # its not like speech rec is going to give us that info anyway...
