%% When the underlying planner is a {\em sequential}/linear planner,
%% i.e., a {\em classical} planner, we say planning is in a sequential
%% {\em session}, and otherwise it is in a {\em decision-theoretic} (DT)
%% session. Finally, planning is continual in the usual sense that,
%% whatever the session, plans are adapted and rebuilt online in reaction
%% to changes to the planning model (e.g. when objectives are modified,
%% or when our robot's path is obstructed by a door being closed). By
%% autonomously mixing these two types of sessions our robot is able to
%% be robust and responsive to changes in its environment
%% \emph{and} make appropriate decisions in the face of uncertainty.
