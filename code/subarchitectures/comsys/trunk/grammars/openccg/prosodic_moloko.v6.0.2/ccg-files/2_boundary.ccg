# Boundary take intermediate phrase of type Rheme ans results into a Rheme intonation phrase.
# Ownership of Rheme is indicated by semantic feature RhOwner in the LF.
# Argument category, an intermediate phrase ("ip"), must bear ACCENT of type Rheme i.e. rhmf as per type definition
# Resultant category is an intonation phrase("cp") with ACCENT of type rhthm as per type definition. 
# This allows unification of two intonation phrases.
