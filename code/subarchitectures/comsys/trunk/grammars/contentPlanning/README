To start the utterance planner debugger:
korbay:[~/dfki] % java comsys.processing.uttplan.UPDebugger
Utterance Planner Debugger v.0.25

An example of planning a communicative goal:

:p @d1:dvp(c-goal  ^ <SpeechAct>assertion  ^ <Relation>answer  ^  <Content>(e1:ascription ^ <Target>(b2:entity ^ <Size>big ^ <InfoStatus>familiar ^ object)  ^ <Type>(b3:entity ^ <Color>red ^ box))) 

Then call the realization:
:r



Utterance planner input:

======
Syntax
======
HLDS

=========
Structure
=========
 
@d1:dvp(c-goal  ^ <SpeechAct>...  ^ <Relation>...  ^  <Modality>... ^ <Content>(...) )

where 

None of the structure elements is required (but the planner is not (yet) completely fool-proof, so ommissions may lead to no output sentence being generated). 

See doc/cogx-testbed.xml for examples of what can be handled.
See doc/cogx-lf.txt for a description of the LF elements
See doc/cogx-targets-Y1.txt for target sentences from demo scripts and alike
See doc/cogx-notes-ikk.txt for to-do and other notes
