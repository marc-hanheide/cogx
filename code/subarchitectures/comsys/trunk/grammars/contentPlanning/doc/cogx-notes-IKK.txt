To do
-------

Java 1.6 problem:
entry condition checking for @type:substance and @feat:NumberID 
systems in delimitation and quantification entered though shouldn't be
for now added checking in the chooser as well

Exclude it-pronominalization when modifiers are present
this is working:
@d1:dvp(c-goal  ^ <SpeechAct>assertion  ^ <Content>(b1:entity ^ ball ^ <Size>big ^ <Color>red ^ <Salient>true)
this is not:
@d1:dvp(c-goal  ^ <SpeechAct>assertion  ^ <Content>(b1:entity ^ ball ^ <Size>big ^ <Color>red ^ <Salient>true ^ <InfoStatus>familiar)

Parse 7: np : 
  @context1_0:entity(context ^ 
                     <Delimitation>unique ^ 
                     <Num>sg ^ 
                     <Quantification>specific ^ 
                     <Modifier>(big1_0:q-size ^ big) ^ 
                     <Modifier>(red1_0:q-color ^ red))


Distinguish feedback according to <Modality>
(vision, discourse)


Check whether conjunction/disjunction in ascription works with all types of objects and all speech acts


DORA: "going to the kitchen"

"I (do not) know this is red"
"I (do not) know what this is"

Ascription wh-questions: alternative formulations
-- what color does the box have
-- which box has blue color
-- what object is this (object)


Multiple properties in ascription
The box is red and big. --> list of properties, not list within one property

Acknowledgment
alternative form:
"Yes you are right"


Multiple utterances within a turn
e.g., sorry, (but) no
      yes, I see
      yes, it is blue
      no, it is not blue
      no/sorry, I do not see that
      yes, it's red
      yes, a red ball	
      ok thanks
      hm, what is that
Problems:
  -- multiple <Content>s  --> need to be extracted and collected into a du-list
  -- Content-nominal reappears  --> messed up graph structure, messed up referencing within LF


NPs with demonstrative determiners
e.g., this/that ball


Proximal vs. distal reference currently selected at random
e.g., this/that	  
      this/that ball



References to multiple objects (set of objects)

e.g., the/these/those balls
      the 3 balls
      these/those
      they				   


Acknowledgments with modality are completely hacked by templates

Utterance planning to-do list:
===============================
(items with "#" are done; items with "??" may not be relevant anymore)

------------------
Planner / debugger
------------------

- ascription + <InfoStatus>familiar in Target: scope-replacement does not happen; why oh why?

- @feat:x without value in system entry condition does not seem to work

- extra "^" in some LF parts, see e.g., 
:p @d1:dvp(c-goal  ^ <SpeechAct>question  ^  <Content>(e1:ascription ^ <Target>(b2:entity ^ box)  ^ <Location>(b3:m-location ^ <Questioned>true))  ) 
Resulting logical form:       
(@d1:dvp(c-goal ^ <SpeechAct>question ^  <Content>(e1:ascription ^ be ^ <DVPassigned>true ^ <AscriptionTargetReplaced>true ^ <Tense>pres ^ <Mood>int ^ <AscriptionProperty>location ^ <AscriptionRelsReplaced>true ^ <QWhProperty>true ^  <Cop-Restr>(b2:entity ^ box ^ <Num>sg ^ <Quantification>specific ^ <Delimitation>existential) ^  <Cop-Scope>(b3:m-location ^ where ^ <Questioned>true) ^  <Subject>(b2:entity ^ box ^ <Num>sg ^ <Quantification>specific ^ <Delimitation>existential) ^  <Wh-Restr>(w1:m-location ^ )))


# inquiry for checking whether a given nominal is the destination (=dependent) of a given relation: needs to look up, not down from the given nominal: f-rel-type, q-deprel-type 

- action for getting the type of a nominal under a certain relation

- ?? copy-feature when applied to copying a nominal under a relation does not create a correct output structure (dangling "^")
  :p @e1:ascription(<Target>(b2:thing ^ box)  ^ <Property>(b3:q-size ^ big)

# support OR in <choicenode> in chooser 

- type subsumption in system-entry conditions and in queries
  (now doing it explicitly)

- making sure words used in LF are in the lexicon (or otherwise handling the ensuing situation when no output is generated appropriately, which needs to be done anyway)

# random choices: random pick in a system, or in a chooser or through random inquiry code?
  through random inquiry code result seems best and most general 
  (can combine random informed decisions in a chooser)
  see utterancePlanner.java: UPResult runSystem 
  see UPGchoiceNode,....

- debugger: feed an edited LF to realizer

# add-feature needs a destination attribute

# LF traversal if system structure.dvp-ident is used

# redux creates a list:

# something is wrong with copy-feature when there are multiple Modifiers
# something is wrong with processing an LF with an embedded element
# cleaning up of irrelevant features in the output ("model reduction")
- cleaning up of dangling relations (currently not needed)


------------------------
Content planning grammar
------------------------

- "what is this room" doesnt work, because what is of type entity: <Cop-Scope>(w1:entity ^ what), but without  delim and quant, and that's hard to block
   so, generating  "what room is this " instead

# <system id="question.wh" region="QUESTIONS" metafunction="ideational">
<!-- need to make sure that this system only ges entered for wh-questions, or that is only inserts specifier for them and not for other ascriptions! -->
 
# quantification and delimitation for pronouns (--> no delim!)

- calling refex algo from the planner

# unique delimitation for expressions produced with refex algo
  feature <Unique>true|false

# exclude nominals under <Subject> relation from applying delimitation and quantification
# exclude nominals under <Compound> relation, too (currently done by assigning type "dummy")

- handling persons: seems to work now at least for simple case; don't know how about embedded in some relation
  Parse 3: np : 
   @g1:person(GJ)

- pronouns should get <Num>sg
   @b1:entity(it)

- Delim and Quant of prop-owner1:entity under Cop-Scope in ascription:
@d1:dvp(c-goal  ^ <SpeechAct>assertion  ^ <Relation>answer  ^  <Content>(e1:ascription ^ <Target>(b2:entity ^ ball)  ^ <Owner>(b3:person ^ GJ)))
@d1:dvp(c-goal  ^ <SpeechAct>assertion  ^ <Relation>answer  ^  <Content>(e1:ascription ^ <Target>(b2:entity ^ ball)  ^ <Owner>(b3:entity ^ robot)))

Final reduced LF: (@e1:ascription(be ^ <Tense>pres ^ <Mood>ind ^  <Cop-Restr>(b2:entity ^ ball ^ <Num>sg ^ <Quantification>specific ^ <Delimitation>existential) ^  <Subject>(b2:entity ^ ball ^ <Num>sg ^ <Quantification>specific ^ <Delimitation>existential) ^  <Cop-Scope>(prop-owner1:entity ^  ^  <Owner>(b3:entity ^ robot ^ <Num>sg ^ <Quantification>specific ^ <Delimitation>existential))))       


- where-ascription questions

- which/what decision un wh-questions

- "How big" would probably be better than "Which size"; but: answer "big"???

- <Owner> in ascription doesn't work: LF not correct yet

-  ascription wh-question: 
   <Shape>(b3:quality ^ shape ^ <Questioned>true))  )
   input could be just 
    <Shape>(b3:quality ^ <Questioned>true))  )
 
# simple quantification & grammatical number
# real quantification using Quantity (see comments in system for known problems)
# simple delimitation

# delimitation and quantification: update "a/one ball" w.r.t. grammar

- handling list structures in OpenCCG format: should already work (if LF does not get messed up)
  decision: input will have FIRST/NEXT list structure 
   - moving locus over conjuncts: not necessary
   - inserting list structure for OpenCCG: not necesary
  test for the presence of first and next in system structure.list: removed the system, don't see need
  # check how come <Next> doesn't get NP attributes  
  # fix that list entity gets plural and nothing else
  remaining problems: reuse of nominals in modifying features (if any, the LF does not generate)

- modifying attributes
  - make simple and complexer version available in parallel!
  - in simple form: <Attribute>value
    # color = only simple string value, nothing fancy; almost done: missing copy feature value;
    # size (same as color) 
problem with current solution: nominal always has the same name when system (re)entered 
- change modifying attributes to the more general: <Property>(p1:q-color ^ red)
  this will make input specification consistent for generating color as attribute of something and generating it stand-alone (as an answer to "What color does x have?")
   - color, size 
   - location (PP!)

- <Quantity>2 does not generate; why?; don't see a prob in LF

- speech act types:
# simple mood and tense
# greetings: opening
- thanking
# ascription assertions (x is red. x is big.)
# ascription questions (What color is/has x? How big is x? 

- assigning InfoStatus to familiar entities from discourse context

- making fool-proof: fill system structure.emptyinput
  it should handle the situation when no input is given from which something sensible would be planned;
for
- a nominal with or without type and no other features, produce "something"
- ..??

  but note: "something" could be produced also in embedded positions when head prop is missing; but, it should not overwrite  cases where the planner planned something
