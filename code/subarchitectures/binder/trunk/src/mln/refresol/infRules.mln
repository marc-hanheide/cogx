// Inference rules

// resolution should be unique
resolution(p1) ^ resolution(p2) => p1 = p2.

// if there exist a percept there must be a resolution (not really necessary)
//(exist p percept(p) ) => (exist q resolution(q)).

// a resolution can be only about a percept that exists ...
resolution(p) => belief(p).
// ... and if there is something attributed
resolution(p) => exist f constraint(f).
