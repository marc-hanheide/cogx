<!-- /**
@system quantification.entity combines the assignment of number and quantification, and also the insertion on an explicit quantifier.  
 Currently, not all choices are "active" (=some choices will never be taken by the corresponding chooser.  
 
Known problems: 

Names of newly inserted nominals are constants, so will be reused when system is entered again, which will lead to unintended "correferences".

Any string as value of input feature "Quantity" will be treated as insertion of an explicit quantifier with that value. Generation will produce nothing in this case. Input should be filtered for actual numbers in the inquiry code. 

Need to exclude cases where the nominal is under <Compound> relation.
