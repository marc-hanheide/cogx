/* Driver for the object tracker component
*
*  @author: Thomas Mörwald, April 2009
*
*  This component is an example on how to control the
*  object tracker by loading a model from ply-file
*  to the working memory and calling several tracking commands.

Testing the tracker
-------------------

The tracker can be tasted by using the "subarchitectures/vision.sa/config/tracker.cast".
Do not press any button while the test is running.
Wait until the message [LOG "TrackerDriver": Tracking test successfull] appears.
If tracking fails please contact me: moerwald@acin.tuwien.ac.at


Loading a ply model
-------------------

The object tracker supports loading of ply model which is described here:
http://local.wasp.uwa.edu.au/~pbourke/dataformats/ply/

Note that the ObjectTracker should not load the models, but the
ObjectTrackerDriver, since in future the tracker will receive the geometry
from Working Memory as well.

../components/ObjectTracker/resources/model/box_blender.ply contains the
data of a box which I generated using blender ply-exporter.

Note that the tracker detects edges using the faces to generate them. This
means that curved surfaces represented by lots of triangles will be full
of edges though in reality they won't be visible since this triangulation
is just an approximation of the surface. I'm currently working on an texture
based object tracker which should be able to cope this problem.

Note that for loading ply-files in other components than the ObjectTracker you
have to include the following lines to your CMakeLists.txt

include_directories(../ObjectTracker)
include_directories(../ObjectTracker/include)
SET(SOURCES ../ObjectTracker/src/ply.c ../ObjectTracker/src/PlyModel.cpp ../ObjectTracker/src/Model.cpp)
add_cast_component(ObjectTrackerDriver ${SOURCES})


Adding model to working memory
------------------------------

The ObjectTracker component listens to the VisualObject::Add. This means,
that whenever an VisualObject is added to Working Memory, the ObjectTracker
converts the GeometryModel of the VisualObject to it's internal format and
adds it to the objects to track when the Tracking command is called. The
definition of an GeometryModel of an VisualObject can be found in VisionData.ice


Tracking commands
-----------------

By now the tracking command supports start and stop tracking and releasing
of all models. It's planned that there will be a tracking command with a
model-id list to define which models to track, release, etc. Look up the
definition in the VisionData.ice


Coordinate System
-----------------
By now I'm using the OpenGL coordinate system. which means that:

x ... points to the right
y ... points upwards
z ... points forward

in the image plane.



I'd welcome any feedback about the Trackers functionality.
