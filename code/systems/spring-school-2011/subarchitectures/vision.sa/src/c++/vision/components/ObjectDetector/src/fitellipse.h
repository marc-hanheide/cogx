//**************************************************************************
// This java code is  an interactive demo of the first ellipse-specific
// direct fitting method presented in the papers:

//    M. Pilu, A. Fitzgibbon, R.Fisher ``Ellipse-specific Direct
//    least-square Fitting '' , IEEE International Conference on Image
//    Processing, Lausanne, September 1996. (poscript) (HTML)

//    A. Fitzgibbon, M. Pilu , R.Fisher ``Direct least-square fitting of
//    Ellipses '' , International Conference on Pattern Recognition, Vienna,
//    August 1996. (poscript) - Extended version available as DAI Research
//    Paper #794

// The demo can be tried out at
//   http://www.dai.ed.ac.uk/students/maurizp/ElliFitDemo/demo.html

// The code was written by Maurizio Pilu , University of Edinburgh.  The
// applet's graphic interface was much inspired by the Curve Applet
// written by Michael Heinrichs at SFU, Vancouver:
// http://fas.sfu.ca:80/1/cs/people/GradStudents/heinrica/personal/curve.html

// Some math routines are from the "Numerical Recipes in C" by
// Press/Teukolsky/Vettering/Flannery, Cambridge Uiniversity Press,
// Second Edition (1988). PLEASE READ COPYRIGHT ISSUES ON THE NUMERICAL
// RECIPES BOOK.

// NOTE: Some parts of the program are rather scruffy. The author
//       will tidy it up whan he has some spare time.

// DISCLAIMER: The authors and the department assume no responsabilities
//             whatsoever for any wrong use of this code.
