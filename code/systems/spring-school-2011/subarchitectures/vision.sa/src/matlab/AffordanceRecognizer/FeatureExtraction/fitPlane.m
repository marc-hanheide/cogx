function  [n,d] = fitPlane(x,y,z)
% FITPLANE Fitting of a plane or hyperplane to a set
%	of points.
%	[N,D] = FITPLANE(X,Y,Z) Calculates a least
%	squares fit to the normal N  to a plane through
%	a set of points with coordinates X,Y,Z in the
%	form  N(1)*X+N(2)*Y+N(3)*Z = D.
%	Normally N is normalized so that D = 1 unless
%	it is close to zero (a plane goes near
%	coordinate system origin).
%	[N,D] = FITPLANE(X,Y) calculates a similar fit
%	to a line, while
%	[N,D] = FITPLANE(R) calculates a fit to a
%	hyper-plane. In this case each row of R
%	must correspond to coordinates of a certain
%	point in a set, such as
%	R = [x1 y1 z1 t1; x2 y2 z2 t2; ...].
