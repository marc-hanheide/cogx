CogX RGB-D Dataset Instructions

The aim of this system is to collect a large RGB-D dataset (alongside with
laser scans and odometry) from all CogX sites. The end result will be publicly available
under as a dataset.


COMPILATION
========================

1. Run ./do-it-al.sh, this compiles the system the usual
way i.e. mkdir BUILD, cmake .. , make install. The
default Cmake options should be sufficient.

2. Now launch castctrl and use the save_data.cast file.
Some remarks:
	-  --save-to-file option: This makes the servers save the sensory data.
	-  --save-directory option: This specifies the place for saving.
	-  --display-rgb in KinectPCServer to see the RGB image (note: for this the opencv should be build with gtk or qt)
If you change nothing these are set as data/rgbd, data/laser and data/odom.

3. The script ./packdata tar.gz the data directory with a new name called: data.tar.gz
4. The script ./cleandata removes the files under data/rgbd, data/laser and data/odom AND data.tar.gz
