vision.sa:

- ARTagRecognizer has a preKnownObjects and ARConfig file under vision/config
	Works like this: The objects in both files should follow the same order. in preKnownObjects, what's important is the object category label
	and that's the name that gets into WM. Whereas in ARConfig, each pattern is associated with a unique id (given while loading the patterns in the component) and a name. 

spatial.sa:
	- As it is now created 2D maps are pretty bad as a result of incorporating maxrange beams from Hokuyo
	- explore-range of SpatialControl should be smaller then max-frontier-dist of PlaceManager
