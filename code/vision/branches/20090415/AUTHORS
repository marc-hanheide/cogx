The CoSy Architecture Schema was principally developed by Nick Hawes
(http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~nah) with help from Henrik Jacobbson
(http://www.dfki.de/~henrikj), Michael Zillich
(http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mxz) and Patric Jensfelt
(http://www.cas.kth.se/~patric). Its development was supported by EU
FP grants CoSy (http://www.cognitivesystems.org) and CogX (http://cogx.eu).
