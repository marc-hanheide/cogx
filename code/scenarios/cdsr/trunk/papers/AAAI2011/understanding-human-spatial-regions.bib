	Abstract = {Dora the Explorer is a mobile robot with a sense of curios- ity and a drive to explore its world. Given an incomplete tour of an indoor environment, Dora is driven by internal motivations to probe the gaps in her spatial knowledge. She actively explores regions of space which she hasn't previously visited but which she expects will lead her to further unex- plored space. She will also attempt to determine the cate- gories of rooms through active visual search for functionally important objects, and through ontology-driven inference on the results of this search.},
