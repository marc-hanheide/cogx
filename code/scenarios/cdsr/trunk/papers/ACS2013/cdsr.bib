@article{Freeman:1961,
	Abstract = {A method is described which permits the encoding of arbitrary geometric configurations so as to facilitate their analysis and manipulation by means of a digital computer. It is shown that one can determine through the use of relatively simple numerical techniques whether a given arbitrary plane curve is open or closed, whether it is singly or multiply connected, and what area it encloses. Further, one can cause a given figure to be expanded, contracted, elongated, or rotated by an arbitrary amount. It is shown that there are a number of ways of encoding arbitrary geometric curves to facilitate such manipulations, each having its own particular advantages and disadvantages. One method, the so-called rectangular-array type of encoding, is discussed in detail. In this method the slope function is quantized into a set of eight standard slopes. This particular representation is one of the simplest and one that is most readily utilized with present-day computing and display equipment.},

	Abstract = {Dora the Explorer is a mobile robot with a sense of curios- ity and a drive to explore its world. Given an incomplete tour of an indoor environment, Dora is driven by internal motivations to probe the gaps in her spatial knowledge. She actively explores regions of space which she hasn't previously visited but which she expects will lead her to further unex- plored space. She will also attempt to determine the cate- gories of rooms through active visual search for functionally important objects, and through ontology-driven inference on the results of this search.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes a new model for understanding natural language commands given to autonomous systems that perform navigation and mobile manipulation in semi-structured environments. Previous approaches have used models with fixed structure to infer the likelihood of a sequence of actions given the environment and the command. In contrast, our framework, called Generalized Grounding Graphs, dynamically instantiates a probabilistic graphical model for a particular natural language command according to the command's hierarchical and compositional semantic structure. Our system performs inference in the model to successfully find and execute plans corresponding to natural language commands such as "Put the tire pallet on the truck." The model is trained using a corpus of commands collected using crowdsourcing. We pair each command with robot actions and use the corpus to learn the parameters of the model. We evaluate the robot's performance by inferring plans from natural language commands, executing each plan in a realistic robot simulator, and asking users to evaluate the system's performance. We demonstrate that our system can successfully follow many natural language commands from the corpus.},

	Abstract = { It is essential for successful human-robot
	                  interaction that the robot is able to both
	                  qualitatively understand the intended meaning of the
	                  human's utterances and to react to them in the
	                  continuous real world. In this paper we present a
	                  number of novel techniques that collectively allow a
	                  robot to interpret and execute spoken commands
	                  describing manipulation goals involving qualitative
	                  spatial constraints (e.g. ``put the red ball near
	                  the blue cube''). The resulting implemented system
	                  integrates computer vision, potential field models
	                  of spatial relationships, and action planning to
	                  mediate between the continuous real world, and
	                  discrete, qualitative representations used for
	                  symbolic reasoning. },
