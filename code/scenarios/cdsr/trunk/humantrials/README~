We would like to analyze the pilot data stored in (results.csv) for the following properties:
- In task 1, we expect the region size to grow between the following regions:
     -- E.g, <stimuli_type>,<stimuli-index> should be smaller than <stimuli_type>,<stimuli-index>
     -- 2,2 should be smaller than 2,4
     -- 2,3 should be smaller than 2,5
     -- 1,2 should be smaller than 1,1
     -- 3,1 should be smaller than 3,2
