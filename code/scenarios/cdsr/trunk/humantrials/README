Files:
- polygoncode.py contains the main classes for computing data about task 1.
-- sample cmd: python polygoncode.py 2013_08_12_PilotBeta.csv
- CDSRDataKey.pdf explains all of the colomns in the current data format
- results.csv contains the pilot human trial results (old format discribed in CDSRStimuliKey.xls)
-- 2013_08_12_PilotBeta.csv is the most recent data
- stimuli contains images of each of the regions used in the experiment along with the .pdfs of the abstract views
- polygondata is a directory that contains preprocessed data used by polycodecode.py
-- This is no longer used
- polygoncode contains a simple pyhton test function to ensure that things are working

Notes from regarding task 2

Room
(100, 188): this is close to the left-hand side of the image (100 pixels from edge).  Should have a high front rating for non-flipped images (including circle) and a low rating for flipped images.
(250, 188): towards the middle of the room.  Should presumably be low for most images.  Would be interesting to see if there is a difference between rows and U/circle for this location
(400, 188): 100 pixels from right-hand side of image.  Should be high for front ratings in flipped images, low otherwise.

Bottleneck
(50, 50): Upper left-hand corner of image (in the light green area).  Presumably should be low for all images.
(450, 310): Lower right corner in the green area.  Should be low as it is past the bottleneck/relatively low?
(330, 200): Close to the middle of the bottle neck for large bottleneck a little towards the bottom of the bottleneck (vertically), still central horizontally for the narrower bottleneck.  Should probably be the highest rated.

Safety:
(235, 300): Behind the line of friendly turrets/tanks, should be highly ranked for safety
(235, 240): In front of line of turrets but behind forward turret.  For tanks, this is still behind the tanks in the position where they are closer to the bad guys (stimuli 3_1).  In front of the tanks when they are further away (stimuli 3_2)
(235, 110): Forward of front turret (should presumably be lowest ranked since no more friendly items between scout and back guys

We would like to analyze the pilot data stored in (results.csv) for the following properties:
- In task 1, we expect the region size to grow between the following regions:
     -- E.g, <stimuli_type>,<stimuli-index> should be smaller than <stimuli_type>,<stimuli-index>
     -- 2,2 should be smaller than 2,4
     -- 2,3 should be smaller than 2,5
     -- 1,2 should be smaller than 1,1
     -- 3,1 should be smaller than 3,2
 - In task 1, we have two trials that assess peoples simulation ability when considering these regions
     -- the upper boundary of Region 3,2 should be higher than the upper boundry of 3,3
     -- The regions should be the same for 3,3 ad 3,4
