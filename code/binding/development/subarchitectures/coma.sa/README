COMA.SA
=======

This is the concpetual mapping subarchitecture. You need the reasoning tools from code/tools/reasoning.
Please read the README in that directory for instructions on how to install necessary external components.

If you then have tools/reasoning and subarchitectures/coma.sa in your build.dirs, you should be able to run ant all.

The coma.sa/config directory contains a few test CAST files. Make sure you edit the paths there.
