CAST file configuration parameters

--calib file .. camera calibration file (internal camera parameters).
                Mandatory.
--camnum num .. camera number (e.g. 0 = left, 1 = right). Defaults to 0.
--eyepose file .. pose calibration file: camera pose w.r.t. "head", which can 
                  be a stereo head or a manipulator hand.
                  If the camera is fixed (not mounted on any head) this pose
                  is just the camera pose w.r.t. the world origin.
                  Defaults to identity.
--headnum num .. head number (e.g. 0 = stereo head, 1 = hand)
--headpose file .. pose calibration file: head pose w.r.t. world origin.
                   In case the head never moves, its pose can be specified
                   here. Defaults to identity.
--downsample .. downsample factor, optional, default 1
