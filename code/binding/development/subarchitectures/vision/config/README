Instruction for runing tests on vision.sa:

0) "svn checkout" the code from the current tag.

1) Run "./vision-test-prep" script.
The script will download the test videos and 
create the necessary link "config" to the test config directory.

2) If Matlab MCR is not installed yet, run "./mcr-install" script to
download and install it (put down the <MCR installation directory>).

3) Make sure the following environment variables are set:

export MCR_ROOT=<MCR installation directory>
export MCR_VER=v77
export XAPPLRESDIR=${MCR_ROOT}/${MCR_VER}/X11/app-defaults

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:\
${MCR_ROOT}/${MCR_VER}/runtime/glnx86:\
${MCR_ROOT}/${MCR_VER}/sys/os/glnx86:\
${MCR_ROOT}/${MCR_VER}/sys/java/jre/glnx86/jre1.6.0/lib/i386/native_threads:\
${MCR_ROOT}/${MCR_VER}/sys/java/jre/glnx86/jre1.6.0/lib/i386/server:\
${MCR_ROOT}/${MCR_VER}/sys/java/jre/glnx86/jre1.6.0/lib/i386

(the best method is to add this to ./bashrc of not yet there)

4) Compile the code.

The first time you build you will get the following warning when configuring
the build with 'ccmake':

FeatureLearningCtf header not installed, yet. Run 'make install' to generate 
and install it. Then run 'ccmake' again. (For now, FeatureLearning won't be built)
(see also: BUILD_FEATURE_LEARNING_CTF)

This should only happen the first time the Feature Learning modules are being built.
After a successfull 'make install' the required header will be in the output
directory and 'ccmake' should not complain any more.

When you receive the above warning, generate the makefiles (press g) and follow the
instructions from the warning.

4) Execute "./run-vision-tests".
