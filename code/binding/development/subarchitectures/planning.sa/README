To install the python/c++ parts, you must run `make` in...

src/python/mapsim/planning/plan_monitor/VAL-4.1/
src/python/mapsim/planning/planner_base/ContinualAxff/


e.g. (from this dir)

make -j2 -C src/python/mapsim/planning/plan_monitor/VAL-4.1/
make -j2 -C src/python/mapsim/planning/planner_base/ContinualAxff/


You will also need to ensure that your PYTHONPATH environment variable
contains the path to...

src/python/mapsim/planning

... else the planning code won't be able to find the necessary python
modules.
