:: In this Dictionary file all lines beginning with :: are considered comments

:: General Remarks- each line that isn't ----pos or --class is a dictionary entry
::                  different forms of the same entry can be separated by :
::                  e.g.  dog:canine means dog and canine have same entry, with dog as stem

::                  The nature of how each entry is interpreted is dependent on the POS
::                  See the comment above each for specifics
