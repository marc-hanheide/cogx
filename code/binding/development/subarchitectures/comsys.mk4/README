1. Introduction

2. How to run and test 
----------------------

before running the system, please make sure all the necessary sources have been compiled:  
   - the logical forms package has been compiled, i.e. run [ ant ] in [ tools/logical-forms ] 
   - the interconnectivity package has been compiled, i.e. run [ ant ] in [ tools/interconnectivity ] 
   - CLASSPATH includes [ code/output/classes ], and [ $OPENCCG_HOME/output/classes]
   - everything compiles -- just run [ ant all ] in $CODE_HOME (i.e. the root of the code distribution)
   - the grammar has been properly compiled, run [ ant ] in [ grammars/New-Moloko ] (ignore any validation problems you may get)

to run the system: 

1) run the corba nameserver: [ tnameserv -ORBInitialPort 1050  & ] 
2) run CAST with a comsys.mk4 CAST configuration. there are currently several test configurations under [ config/test-configurations ], e.g. 

	[ java cast.server.CASTProcessServer -h localhost -f config/test-configurations/test1-SYS.cast ] -- just the comsys with the visualizer
	
	[ java cast.server.CASTProcessServer -h localhost -f config/test-configurations/test2-SYS.cast ] -- comsys with the visualizer, binding subarch, comsys binding monitor

   
    there are also platform-specific shell-scripts to run these configurations, under [ scripts/ ] 
   

3. Documentation
----------------

Standard DOXYGEN documentation can be generated by running [doxygen] in the root directory [ subarchitectures/comsys.mk4 ].
