\page explorerSAs Status of Explorer Subarchitecure

\section navsa-int-head ================= Navigation.sa =================

Responsible: Patric

The navigation subarchitecure is responsible for building the map,
keeping the robot localized in that map, track people and move the
robot in the environment

\subsection navsa-work Working and tested functionality

  \li Can build map (metric and graph) and save these to file
  \li Can load map from file and re-initialize position if position given in file
  \li Can perform GOTO actions

\subsection navsa-todo TODO

  \li Provide interface to get laser map (Dorian(KTH))
  \li Laser-based person detection (Daniel(ALU))
  \li Laser-based people-tracker (Patric(KTH))
  \li laser+vision place classifier (Daniel(ALU), Andrzej(KTH))
  \li People detection and tracking, i.e. using the information from
  laser and vision and fuse them to get an estimate of the people
  around (Daniel(ALU), Niko(TUD) and Patric(KTH))
  \li Interface for external SAs (Dorian(KTH))
  \li Feedback to external SAs (Dorian(KTH))
  \li Binding monitors (Kristoffer(KTH))
  \li Binding proxy for robot pose (Kristoffer(KTH))

\section visionsa-int-head ================= Vision.sa =================

Responsible: Niko

The vision subarchitecture in the explorer instantiation of the system
has as primary tasks to detect/recognize people and objects.

\subsection visionsa-work Working and tested functionality

  \li ??

\subsection visionsa-todo TODO

  \li Mount stereo-camera on Minnie (Dorian(KTH))
  \li How do we make the information here available to the rest of the system (Niko(TUD) + Dorian(KTH))
  \li Visual person detection (Niko(TUD))
  \li Face detection (Niko(TUD))

\section objectsa-int-head ================= Object Search.sa =================

Responsible: Kristoffer/Dorian

The object search architecture will use the navigation and vision SAs
to move the robot around and look for objects.

\section bindersa-int-head ================= Binder.sa =================

Responsible: Henrik

Note that Henrik is only responsible for the binder itself. It is up
to each an every SA to work out what needs to be written to the
Binder, and how to bind stuff there. For the latter will be a
discussion between the people from the involved SAs.
