\mainpage a template spec.... or it will be...

The representations etc can be referred to through just writing the
name of a class: MyClass, but it looks prettier like this: \c MyClass

\sa \c MyMonitor \c MyComponent

And external types can also be referred to easily: \c
BindingData::BindingProxy, \c ComsysEssentials, \c PlanningData, \c
cast::cdl , \c Vision or \p ObjectClassDetector etc... Doxygen does
the work for you...

Here we can make sequence diagrams and... whatever...

\msc
    hscale = "2.4";
    MyComponent[URL="\ref MyComponent"],MyClass[URL="\ref MyClass"],AnotherComponent,MyMonitor[URL="\ref MyMonitor"];
    MyComponent=>MyClass[label="f()", URL="\ref MyClass::f()"];
    MyComponent<<MyClass[label="int"];
    MyClass=>MyMonitor[label="where_is_my_feature()", URL="\ref MyMonitor::where_is_my_feature()"];
    MyMonitor=>MyComponent[label="where_am_i()", URL="\ref MyComponent::where_am_i()"];
    ...[label="Some significant amout of processing takes place"];
    MyComponent<<MyMonitor[label="WorkingMemoryAddress", URL ="\ref cast::cdl::WorkingMemoryAddress"];
    MyClass<<MyMonitor[label="FeaturePointer", URL="\ref BindingData::FeaturePointer"];	
    MyComponent->AnotherComponent[label="Hello"];
    ---[label="some state is achieved"];
\endmsc

You can also make crossreferences to pretty much anything with an
anchor. For sections and subsections, you always get an achor. Look at
this subpage for example \ref images.

A lot can be said about paragraphs, sections, subsections, pages etc
etc... but doxygen is already well documented <a
href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/commands.html">documented</a>.

\par a paragraph looks like this
and this is the text of the paragraph

\section section a section looks like this
\subsection section a subsection looks like this
\subsection subsection a subsection looks like this
\section section a section looks like this
\section section a section looks like this
\subsection subsection a subsection looks like this
\subsubsection subsubsection a subsubsection looks like this
\subsubsection subsubsection a subsubsection looks like this

Code examples can be given too.
\code
// some example code
int main() {
  return 0;
}
\endcode

Code examples can be included from source too, which is extremely
convenient when you want your documentation to be consistent with sth
you know compiles (it takes some messing with the \c Doxygen file, though):

\include FunnyMan.java

\page images A subpage with externally generated images

This text could be defined in any file actually. Just don't forget to refer to it...

Would he stand here if the arm was controlled by the cosy architecture?
\image html "http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~hic/Georgia-HomePage/Home_files/shapeimage_2.jpg"

This one is familiar and refers to <a
href="../../../tools/comedian-architecture/doc/java/html/index.html">comedian</a>
subarchitecture. (also in java version) 

\image html fetch.php.png

Or we can import internally generated images too: \image html classMyClass__coll__graph.png You just need to figure out doxygen's
autogenerated filenames by looking at the generated pages.
