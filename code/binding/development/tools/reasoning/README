Reasoning 
=========

The "reasoning" package provides a generic API for reasoners/inference engines. It includes an
abstract API definition and also an implementation for the Pellet open source OWL-DL reasoner.

NB: this description is based on using Pellet 1.5.1 -- this replaces Pellet 1.5.0!

The external reasoner Pellet is written in Java and can be obtained from [http://pellet.owldl.com/].
Additional libraries, namely the OWLAPI, are now part of the Pellet distribution.

CoSy users can get Pellet from the svn repository. Get "pellet-1.5.1.zip" from "packages".

In any case, make sure the required external libraries (see below) are in your CLASSPATH, 
e.g. by adding the following lines to your ~/.bashrc file:
export PELLET_ROOT:<path_to_where_you_unzipped_pellet>
export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:$PELLET_ROOT/lib/pellet.jar
export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:$PELLET_ROOT/lib/aterm-java-1.6.jar
export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:$PELLET_ROOT/lib/owlapi/owlapi-api.jar
export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:$PELLET_ROOT/lib/owlapi/owlapi-apibinding.jar
