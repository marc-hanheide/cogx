hardware/rgbd

Place for all current and future RGB-D camera server code.
Currently there is a server for Microsoft Kinect sensor: KinectPushServer
KinectPushServer operates very much like Odometry and LaserScan push servers.
There is a test component under .../src/c++/test and a corresponding cast file for quick checking your sensor.

Installation:
 1) Install unstable OpenNI (http://www.openni.org/downloadfiles/openni-binaries/20-latest-unstable)
 2) Install SensorKinect unstable (https://github.com/avin2/SensorKinect)
The README file at SensorKinect gives a pretty good guide on installation.
