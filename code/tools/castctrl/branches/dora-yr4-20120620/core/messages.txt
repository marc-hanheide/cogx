CLogMessageSource creates CMessages. A CLogMerger visits every registered 
CLogMessageSource and calls its pushLogMessages() to push the messages from the 
source into every CLogSink that is registered with the source. Then the 
CLogMerger visits all CLogSink-s associated with it and merges the CMessages 
into a queue ordered by time/order.

The CLogMerger then acts as a CLogMessageSource for various CLogDisplayer-s.
