To configure the logging levels for individual components, create a text file 
(eg. logs/loggers.ini) with the logging levels of individual components. The 
file should contain log4j options in the form:

   <subarchitecture-id>.<component-id>=LOGLEVEL

eg.:

   vision.sa.videoserver=ERROR

The valid log levels are: ALL, TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL

In Cast Control enter the path to this file into the 'Levels' field in 'Logs'.
The settings will be appended (with a prefix) to the log4j.properties file for 
clients (logs/cctmp.log4client.conf).
