HANG ON A SEC, SOME OF THIS SOFTWARE WAS WRITTEN BY PEOPLE OTHER THAN
YOURSELF (and other members of the CogX-posse) -- PLEASE EXPLAIN?!
----------------------------------------------------------------------

I have included a bunch of other peoples software libraries for
convenience. Saves you having to download them, and they are open
source for non-commercial use anyway.

 - Everything with a "pegtl" is from the PEGTL library by Dr. Colin
   Hirsch. This C++-0X source code was downloaded from
   \url{http://code.google.com/p/pegtl/}. I used the library from the
   problem and domain parsing functionality.

 - Everything withing the ayPlan subdirectory is a cost(also step if
   you like)-optimal planner for the deterministic case. That is a
   semi-open source software system I wrote while employed by NICTA
   (National ICT Australia -- ICT == Information and Computer
   Technology).
